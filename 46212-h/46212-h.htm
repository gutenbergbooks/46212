<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In 1884 I issued a volume on "The Blood Covenant:
A Primitive Rite and its Bearings on Scripture."
Later I was led to attempt, and to announce as in
preparation, another volume in the field of primitive
covenants, including a treatment of "The Name
Covenant," "The Covenant of Salt," and "The
Threshold Covenant." In 1896, I issued a separate
volume on "The Threshold Covenant," that subject
having grown into such prominence in my studies as
to justify its treatment by itself. These two works,
"The Blood Covenant" and "The Threshold Covenant,"
have been welcomed by scholars on both sides
of the ocean to an extent beyond my expectations,
and in view of this I venture to submit some further
researches in the field of primitive thought and
customs.</p>

<p>Before the issuing of my second volume, I had prepared
the main portion of this present work on "The
Covenant of Salt," but since then I have been led to
revise it, and to conform it more fully to my latest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
conclusion as to the practical identity of all covenants.
It is in this form that I present it, as a fresh contribution
to the study of archeology and of anthropology.</p>

<p>As I have come to see it, as a result of my researches,
the very idea of a "covenant" in primitive
thought is a union of being, or of persons, in a common
life, with the approval of God, or of the gods.
This was primarily a sharing of blood, which is life,
between two persons, through a rite which had the
sanction of him who is the source of all life. In
this sense "blood brotherhood" and the "threshold
covenant" are but different forms of one and the
same <i>covenant</i>. The blood of animals shared in a
common sacrifice is counted as the blood which makes
two one in a sacred covenant. Wine as "the blood
of the grape" stands for the blood which is the life
of all flesh; hence the sharing of wine stands for the
sharing of blood or life. So, again, salt represents
blood, or life, and the covenant of salt is simply another
form of the one blood covenant. This is the main
point of this new monograph. So far as I know, this
truth has not before been recognized or formulated.</p>

<p>Similarly the sharing of a common name, especially
of the name of God, or of a god, is the claim of a
divinely sanctioned covenant between those who bear
it. It is another mode of claiming to be in the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
vital covenant. A temporary agreement, or truce,
between two who share a drink of water or a morsel
of bread, is a lesser and very different thing from
entering into a covenant, which by its very nature is
permanent and unchangeable. This difference is
pointed out and emphasized in the following pages.</p>

<p>In these new investigations, as in my former ones,
I have been aided, step by step, by specialists, who
have kindly given me suggestions and assistance by
every means in their power. This furnishes a fresh
illustration of the readiness of all scholars to aid any
fresh worker in any line where their own labors render
them an authority or a guide.</p>

<p>Besides my special acknowledgments in the text
and footnotes of this volume, I desire to express my
indebtedness and thanks to these scholars who have
freely rendered me important assistance at various
points in my studies: Professor Dr. Hermann V. Hilprecht,
the Rev. Drs. Marcus Jastrow, K. Kohler, and
Henry C. McCook, Professor Drs. Hermann Collitz,
H. Carrington Bolton, William H. Roberts, Morris
Jastrow, Jr., F. K. Sanders, William A. Lamberton,
W. W. Keen, William Osler, J. W. Warren, and D. C.
Munro, Drs. J. Solis Cohen, Thomas G. Morton, Charles
W. Dulles, Henry C. Cattell, and Frederic H. Howard,
Rev. Dean E. T. Bartlett, President Robert E. Thompson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Drs. Talcott Williams, Henry C. Lea, and T. H.
Powers Sailer, Messrs. Clarence H. Clark and Patterson
Du Bois.</p>

<p>This third work is to be considered in connection
with the two which have preceded it in the same field.
It is hoped that it will be recognized as adding an
important thought to the truths brought out in those
works severally.</p>

<p>A previously published monograph on "The Ten
Commandments as a Covenant of Love" is added to
"The Covenant of Salt" as a Supplement, in order
that it may be available to readers of this series of
volumes on covenants, as a historical illustration of
the subject under discussion.</p>

<h2>I<br />
CHARACTERISTICS OF A COVENANT</h2>


<p>Our English word "covenant," like many another
word in our language and in other languages, fails to
convey, or even to contain, its fullest and most important
meaning in comparison with the idea back of
it. As a matter of fact, this must be true of nearly all
words. Ideas precede words. Ideas have spirit and
life before they are shaped or clothed in words.
Words have necessarily human limitations and imperfectness,
because of their purely human origin.</p>

<p>When an idea first seeks expression in words, it is
inevitable that it be cramped by the means employed
for its conveyance. At the best the word can only
<i>suggest</i> the idea back of it, rather than accurately
<i>define</i> and explain that idea. In practice, or in continued
and varied use, in the development of thought
and of language, changes necessarily occur in the
word or words selected to convey a primal idea, in
order to indicate other phases of the idea than that
brought out or pointed to by the first chosen word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
While these changes and additions aid some persons
to an understanding of the root idea, they tend to
confuse others, especially those who are looking for
exactness of definition.</p>

<p>As a rule, the earlier words chosen for the expression
of an idea are more likely than later ones to
suggest the main thought seeking expression. Hence
there is often a gain in looking back among the Greek
and Sanskrit and Hebrew and Assyrian roots carried
forward by religion or commerce into our English
words and idioms, when we are searching for the true
meaning of an important custom or rite or thought.
Yet this will ordinarily be confusing rather than clarifying
to an exact scholar. Only as a person is intent
on the primal thought back of the chosen word is he
likely to perceive the true meaning and value of the
suggestions of the earlier word or words found in his
searching.</p>

<p>Archeology is sometimes more valuable than philology
in throwing light on the meaning of ancient
words. It is often easier to explain the use of an
archaic word by a disclosed primitive custom or rite,
than to discern a hidden primitive rite or custom by
a study of the words used in referring to it. An
archeologist may suggest a solution of a problem
which hopelessly puzzles the lexicographer or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
grammarian. Sentiment and the poetic instinct are often
more helpful, in such research, than prescribed etymological
methods. He who looks for an exact
definition can never reach a conclusion. If he seeks
a suggestion, he may find one.</p>

<p>"Covenant," as an English word, simply means,
according to its etymological signification, "a coming
together." At times the word is used interchangeably
with such words as "an agreement," "a league," "a
treaty," "a compact," "an arrangement," "an obligation,"
or "a promise." Only by its context and connections
are we shown in special cases that a covenant
bond has peculiar or pre-eminent sacredness and
perpetuity. This truth is, however, shown in many
an instance, especially in translations from earlier
languages.</p>

<p>Even in our use of the English word "covenant"
we have to recognize, at times, its meaning as a sacred
and indissoluble joining together of the two parties
covenanting, as distinct from any ordinary agreement
or compact. And when we go back, as in our English
Bible, to the Greek and Hebrew words rendered
"covenant," or "testament," or "oath," in a sworn
bond, we find this distinction more strongly emphasized.
It is therefore essential to a correct view
of any form of primitive covenanting that we understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the root idea in this primal sort of coming
together.</p>

<p>Primitive covenanting was by two persons cutting
into each other's flesh, and sharing by contact, or by
drinking, the blood thus brought out. Earliest it was
the personal blood of the two parties that was the
nexus of their covenant. Later it was the blood of a
shared and eaten sacrifice that formed the covenant
nexus. In such a case the food of the feast became
a part of the life of each and both, and fixed their
union. In any case it was the common life into
which each party was brought by the covenant that
bound them irrevocably. This fixed the binding of
the two as permanent and established.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Lexicographers and critics puzzle over the supposed
Hebrew or Assyrian origin of the words translated
"covenant" in our English Bible, and they fail
to agree even reasonably well on the root or roots involved.
Yet all the various words or roots suggested
by them have obvious reference to the primal idea of
covenanting as a means of life-sharing; therefore their
verbal differences are, after all, of minor importance,
and may simply point to different stages in the progressive
development of the languages.</p>

<p>Whether, therefore, the root of the Hebrew <i>b&#277;reeth</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
means, as is variously claimed, "to cut," "to fetter,"
"to bind together," "to fix," "to establish," "to
pour out," or "to eat," it is easy to see how these
words may have been taken as referring to the one
primitive idea of a compassed and established union.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
So in the Greek words <i>diath&#275;k&#275;</i> and <i>horkion</i> it can
readily be seen that the references to the new placing
or disposing of the parties, to their solemn appeal to
God or the gods in the covenanting, and to the testament
to take effect after the death of the testator, or
to the means employed in this transaction, are alike
consistent with the primitive idea of a covenant in
God's sight by which one gives over one's very self,
or one's entire possessions, to another. The pledged
or merged personality of the two covenantors fully
accounts for the different suggested references of the
variously employed words.</p>

<p>True marriage is thus a covenant, instead of an
arrangement. The twain become no longer two, but
one; each is given to the other; their separate identity
is lost in their common life. A ring, a bracelet,
a band, has been from time immemorial the symbol
and pledge of such an indissoluble union.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>Men have thus, many times and in many ways,
signified their covenanting, and their consequent interchange
of personality and of being, by the exchange
of certain various tokens and symbols; but these exchanges
have not in any sense been the covenant
itself, they have simply borne witness to a covenant.
Thus men have exchanged pledges of their covenant
to be worn as phylacteries, or caskets, or amulets, or
belts, on neck, or forehead, or arm, or body;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> they
have exchanged weapons of warfare or of the chase;
they have exchanged articles of ordinary dress, or of
ornament, or of special utility;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> they have exchanged
with each other their personal names.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> All these
have been in token of an accomplished covenant, but
they have not been forms or rites of the covenant
itself.</p>

<p>Circumcision is spoken of in the Old Testament as
the token of a covenant between the individual and
God. It is so counted by the Jew and the Muhammadan.
In Madagascar, as illustrative of outside nations,
it is counted as the token of a covenant between
the individual and his earthly sovereign. The ceremonies
accompanying it all go to prove this.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
men have covenanted with one another to merge their
common interests, and to obliterate or ignore their
racial, tribal, or social distinctions, as no mere treaty
or league could do.</p>

<p>In tradition and in history men have covenanted
with God, or with their gods, so that they could claim
and bear the divine name as their own, thus sharing
and representing the divine personality and power.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Thus also in tradition different gods of primitive peoples
and times have covenanted with one another, so
that each was the other, and the two were the same.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>There are seeming traces of this root idea of covenanting,
through making two one by merging the life
of each in a common life, in words that make "union"
out of "one." In the Welsh <i>un</i> is "one;" <i>uno</i> is
"to unite." In the English, from the Latin, a unit
unites with another unit, and the two are unified in
the union. The two by this merging become not a
<i>double</i>, but a larger <i>one</i>. Thus it is always in a true
covenant.</p>

<p>We have to study the meaning and growth of words
in the light of ascertained primitive customs and rites
and ideas, instead of expecting to learn from ascertained
root-words what were the prevailing primal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
ideas and rites and customs in the world. In the line
of such studying, covenants and the covenant relation
have been found to be an important factor, and to
have had a unique significance in the development of
human language and in the progress of the human
race from its origin and earliest history. The study
and disclosures of the primitive covenant idea in its
various forms and aspects have already brought to
light important truths and principles, and the end is
not yet.</p>

<h2>II<br />
A COVENANT OF SALT</h2>


<p>Among the varied forms of primitive covenanting,
perhaps none is more widely known and honored, or
less understood, the world over, than a covenant of salt,
or a salt covenant. Religion and superstition, civilization
and barbarism, alike deal with it as a bond or
rite, yet without making clear the reasons for its use.
The precise significance and symbolism of salt as the
nexus of a lasting covenant is by no means generally
understood or clearly defined by even scholars and
scientists. The subject is certainly one worthy of
careful consideration and study.</p>

<p>A covenant of salt has mention, in peculiar relations,
in the Bible. It is prominent in the literature
and traditions of the East. Here in our Western
world there are various folk-lore customs and sayings
that show familiarity with it as a vestige of primitive
thought. Among the islands of the sea, and in out-of-the-way
corners of the earth, it shows itself as
clearly as in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>In some regions salt is spoken of as if it were
merely an accompaniment of bread, and thus a common
and indispensable article of food; but, again, its
sharing stands out as signifying far more than is meant
by an ordinary meal or feast. An explanation of its
meaning, frequently offered or accepted by students
and specialists, is that in its nature it is a preservative
and essential, and therefore its presence adds value to
an offering or to a sacramental rite.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But the mind cannot
be satisfied with so superficial an interpretation as
this, in view of many things in text and tradition that
go to show a unique sacredness of salt as salt, rather
than as a preserver and enlivener of something that is
of more value. It is evident that the true symbolism
and sanctity of salt as the nexus of a covenant lie
deeper than is yet admitted, or than has been formally

<h2>III<br />
BIBLE REFERENCES TO THE RITE</h2>


<p>A "covenant of salt" seems to stand quite by itself
in the Bible record. Covenants made in blood, and
again as celebrated by sharing a common meal, and
by the exchange of weapons and clothing, and in
various other ways, are of frequent mention; but a
covenant of salt is spoken of only three times, and in
every one of these cases as if it were of peculiar and
sacred significance; each case is unique.</p>

<p>The Lord speaks of his covenant with Aaron and
his sons, in the privileges of the priesthood in perpetuity,
as such a covenant. To him he says: "All
the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
of Israel offer unto the Lord, have I given thee,
and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a due
for ever: it is a <i>covenant of salt</i> for ever before the
Lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Of the Lord's covenant with David and his seed, in
the rights and privileges of royalty, Abijah the king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Judah says to Jeroboam, the rival king of Israel: "O
Jeroboam and all Israel; ought ye not to know that
the Lord, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over
Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by
a <i>covenant of salt</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Again, the Lord, through Moses, enjoins it upon
the people of Israel to be faithful in the offering of
sacrifices at his altar, according to the prescribed
ritual. "Neither shalt thou suffer the <i>salt of the
covenant</i> of thy God," he says, "to be lacking from
thy meal offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt
offer salt."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>While the word "covenant" appears more than
two hundred and fifty times in the Old Testament, it
is a remarkable fact that the term "covenant of salt"
occurs in only these three instances, and then in such
obviously exceptional connections. The Lord's covenant
with Aaron and his seed in the priesthood, and
with David and his seed in the kingship, is as a covenant
of salt, perpetual and unalterable. And God's
people in all their holy offerings are to bear in mind
that the salt is a vital element and factor, if they
would come within the terms of the perpetual and
unalterable covenant.</p>

<p>In the Bible, God speaks to men by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
human language; and in the figures of speech which
he employs he makes use of terms which had and
have a well-known significance among men. His
employment of the term "covenant of salt" as implying
permanency and unchangeableness to a degree
unknown to men, except in a covenant of blood as a
covenant of very life, is of unmistakable significance.</p>

<p>There are indeed incidental references, in another
place in the Old Testament, to the prevailing primitive
idea that salt-sharing is covenant-making. These
references should not be overlooked.</p>

<p>In many lands, and in different ages, salt has been
considered the possession of the government, or of
the sovereign of the realm, to be controlled by the
ruler, as a source of life, or as one of its necessaries,
for his people. In consequence of this the receiving
of salt from the king's palace has been deemed a fresh
obligation of fidelity on the part of his subjects. This
is indicated in a Bible passage with reference to the
rebuilding by Zerubbabel of the Temple at Jerusalem,
under the edict of Cyrus, king of Persia. "The adversaries
of Judah and Benjamin" protested against the
work as a seditious act. In giving their reason for this
course they said: "Now because we eat the salt of
the palace [because we are bound to the king by a
covenant of salt], and it is not meet for us to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified
the king."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>And so again when King Darius showed his confidence
in the Jews by directing a supply, from the royal
treasury, of material for sacrifices at the Temple, and
a renewal of the means of covenanting, he declared:
"Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to these
elders of the Jews for the building of this house of
God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute
beyond the river, expenses be given with all diligence
unto these men, that they be not hindered.
And that which they have need of, both young bullocks,
and rams, and lambs, for burnt offerings to the
God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according
to the word of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let
it be given them day by day without fail: that they
may offer sacrifices of sweet savor unto the God of
heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his
sons."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> And again, in further detail: "Unto an hundred
talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat,
and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred
baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much;"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
the more salt they took, the more surely and firmly
they were bound.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
BREAD AND SALT</h2>


<p>"There would be nothing eatable," says Plutarch,
"without salt, which, mixed with flour, seasons bread
also. Hence it was that Neptune and Ceres [or
Poseidon and Demeter as the Greeks called them]
had both the same temple."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> And from the days of
Plutarch until now, as has been already mentioned, it
has been customary to speak of the "covenant of
salt" as synonymous with the "covenant of bread and
salt;" or as identical with the covenant of food-sharing
in the rite of hospitality. But the covenant of salt
among primitive peoples has, and ever has had, a
sacredness and depth of meaning far beyond what
is involved in the ordinary sharing of food.</p>

<p>Even the sharing of water between two persons, or
the giving and receiving of a drink of water, is a compact
of peace for the time being, as a truce between
enemies.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The sharing of bread, or of flesh, means yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
more than the sharing of water. It brings those who
join in it into the league or treaty of hospitality, by
which the host is pledged to his guest while he is a
guest, and for a reasonable time after his departure.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Durzee Bey, a native chieftain in Mesopotamia,
having put a bit of roast meat into the mouth of Dr.
Hamlin, as they sat together in his domicil, said: "By
that act I have pledged you every drop of my blood,
that <i>while you are in my territory</i> no evil shall come
to you. <i>For that space of time</i> we are brothers."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
"Where enmity subsists, the fiercer Arabs will not sit
down at the same table with their adversary; sitting
down together betokens reconciliation."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>A covenant of salt is, however, permanent and unalterable,
as the truce or treaty is not. Yet this distinction,
recognized by Orientals, does not seem to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
observed by all writers on Oriental customs, even by
those who are generally observant and experienced.</p>

<p>It is true that the sharing of salt is usually an accompaniment
of bread-sharing; hence, a covenant of
salt between two parties is generally, although not
always, made by their partaking of bread and salt
together. Moreover, because salt is a common ingredient
in Oriental bread, the eating of bread with
another in the East may include the sharing of salt
with him; but in such a case it is the salt, and not the
bread, which is the nexus of the perpetual covenant,
in its distinction from the temporary compact of hospitality
in the sharing of bread. The bread is the
vehicle of the covenant-making salt. Indeed, they
have it for a proverb among Arabs and Syrians, "My
bread had no salt in it," as a mode of accounting for
any act of treachery, or failure in fidelity toward one
who was a partaker of the bread of hospitality.</p>

<p>In the famous Oriental story of "Ali Baba and the
Forty Thieves," the captain of the robber band who
had visited Ali Baba in order to murder him was unwilling
to partake of any food which had salt in it.
This carefulness it was that excited the suspicion of
Morgiana, the faithful slave girl, and led her to ask,
"Who is he that eateth [only] meat wherein is no
salt?" And when she recognized the robber captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
under his disguise, she said to herself: "So ho! this
is the cause why the villain eateth not of salt, for that
he seeketh now an opportunity to slay my master,
whose mortal enemy he is."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This man was ready
enough to partake of bread and flesh as a guest, and
then strike his host to the heart in violation of all the
obligations of hospitality; as, indeed, has been done in
many a case in the East in early and in recent times,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
but he could not consent, robber and murderer as he
was, to disregard a sacred "covenant of salt."</p>

<p>The story of the origin of the dynasty of the Saffaride
Kaleefs, in the ninth century, is an illustration
of the surpassing power of the covenant of salt. Laiss-el-Safar,
or Laiss the coppersmith, was an obscure
worker in brass and copper, in Khorassan, a province
of Persia. His son Yakoob wrought for a time at his
father's trade, and then became a robber chieftain.</p>

<p>Having on one occasion found his way by night
through a subterranean passage into the treasury of
the palace of the governor, Nassar Seyar, who was
then in control of Seiestan, Yakoob gathered jewels
and costly stuffs, and was proceeding to carry them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
off. Striking his bare foot, in the darkness, against a
hard and sharp substance on the floor of the room, he
thought it might be a jewel, and stooped to pick it
up. Putting it to his tongue, to test it after the manner
of lapidaries, he discovered that it was rock salt
that he had tasted in the governor's palace. At once
he threw down his bale of stolen goods, and left the
palace by the way he had entered.</p>

<p>The signs of attempted robbery being found the
next morning, the governor caused a proclamation to
be made throughout the city, that, if the man who had
entered the treasury would make himself known at the
palace, he should be pardoned, and should be shown
marks of special favor. Yakoob accordingly presented
himself at the palace, and freely told his story. The
governor felt that a man who would hold thus sacred
the covenant of salt could be depended on, and Yakoob
was given a position near his person.</p>

<p>Step by step Yakoob went forward to power and
honors, until he was chief ruler of Khorassan, and
founder of the Saffaride dynasty in the Persian khaleefate.
He died A.D. 878, and was succeeded by
his brother, Omar II.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Baron du Tott, the Hungarian French traveler
among the Turks and Tatars, tells of his experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
in this line with one Moldovanji Pasha, who desired a
closer intimacy than was practicable in the brief time
the two were to be together. "I had already," says
the Baron du Tott, "attended him halfway down the
staircase [of my house], when stopping, and turning
briskly to one of my domestics who followed me,
'Bring me directly,' said he, 'some bread and salt.' I
was not less surprised at this fancy than at the haste
which was made to obey him. What he requested
was brought, when, taking a little salt between his
fingers, and putting it with a mysterious air on a bit
of bread, he ate it with a devout gravity, assuring me
that I might now rely on him."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Stephen Schultz, in his Travels through Europe,
Asia, and Africa, gives this illustration of the binding
force of the covenant of salt: "On the 13th of June
[1754] the deacon, Joseph Diab, a custom-house
clerk, was at table with us. Referring to the salt
which stood on the table, he said that the Arabs make
use of it as a token of friendship. While they are
fond of it, they do not like to place it on the table.
On one occasion, when he was with a caravan traveling
to Babel [Bagdad], they came into a neighborhood
where Arabs were encamped. In the caravan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
was a rich merchant. Seeing that one of the Arabs
was making ready to come to the caravan, he buried
his money in the ground, built a fire over it, and then
sat down to eat with the others near the fire. When
the Arabs arrived they were welcomed pleasantly, and
invited to eat. They accepted the invitation and sat
down at the table. But when their leader saw the
salt on the table, he said to the merchant, 'My loss is
your gain; for as I have eaten at a table on which is
salt, I cannot, must not, harm you.' When that
caravan started on its way, the Arab leader not only
refrained from taking what he had intended to demand,
but he escorted them without reward as far as
the Euphrates, and gave them over into the care of
the Pasha of Bagdad, as friends of his prince Achsam.
They were now safe."</p>

<p>Schultz adds: "It is not customary among Arabs
to place salt on a common table, but only when an
Arab prince enters into an alliance with a pacha, which
is called <i>baret-millah</i>, or the salt alliance. This is
done as follows: The Arab prince, when he wishes to
live within the jurisdiction of a pacha sends messengers
to him to ask whether he may dwell in his territory
as an ally. If the pacha consents, he sends messengers
to the prince, informing him that they will
meet on such a day. When the day arrives the pacha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
rides out to meet the prince, in the field which he has
selected for his dwelling, and conducts him to his own
quarters. Then the Arab prince asks the pacha how
much he is to pay for permission to dwell in that field.
The bargain is soon concluded, according to the extent
of the Arab encampment.</p>

<p>"As soon as the bargain is concluded, a repast is
prepared, and a salt-cellar, with some pieces of bread
on a flat dish, is carried round the apartment by the
pacha's servants. The dish is first presented to the
pacha, who takes a piece of bread, dips it in the salt,
and, holding it between two fingers toward the prince,
calls out, 'Salaam!' that is Peace, 'I am the friend
of your friend, and the enemy of your enemy.' The
dish is now presented to the Arab prince, who likewise
takes a piece of bread, dips it in the salt, and
says to the pacha, 'Peace! I am the friend of your
friend, and the enemy of your enemy!' Thereupon
the dish with the bread is handed to the chief men of
the Arab prince, and to the ministers of the pacha, who
receive it in the same manner as their principals; with
the exception that they simply say, on taking the
bread, 'Salaam!' 'Peace'"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Don Raphel speaking of the "conventions," or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
rather the "covenants," which are recognized by the
Bed'ween as sacredly binding on them, says: "One
kind of these conventions is made by their putting
some grains of salt with pieces of bread into each
other's mouths, saying, 'By the rite of bread and
salt,' or, 'By this salt and bread, I will not betray
thee.' No oath is added; for the more sacred an
oath appears to be, the more easily does an Arab violate
it. But a convention concluded in this manner
derives its force merely from opinion, and this is indeed
extraordinary.... If a stranger who meets with
them in the desert, or comes to a camp, or before he
departs from a city, can oppose this alliance to their
rapacity, his baggage and his life are more safe, even
in the midst of the desert, than during the first days
of his journey with the securities of twenty hostages.
The Arab with whom he has eaten bread and salt,
and all the Arabs of his tribe, consider him as their
countryman and brother. There is no kind of respect,
no proof of regard, which they do not show him."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Volney says of the Druzes, "When they have contracted
with their guests the sacred engagement of
bread and salt, no subsequent event can make them violate
it."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This Volney illustrates by notable incidents.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Finn, wife of the English consul at Jerusalem,
who was long resident in the East, gives the following
illustration of the importance of salt as well as bread
to a binding covenant. After a feast in the Hebron
district of Palestine, one of the persons who shared it
was waylaid and murdered by hired assassins. "One
of the men (Abdallah) concerned in the deed, not as
an actor, but as spectator, had been the night before
actually eating with the victim. On hearing what had
happened, the poor fellah woman who had cooked
their supper, and who was much attached to the
murdered man, bewailed herself, beating her breast
and crying, 'Wo is me! wo is me! I left out the
salt by mistake when making the bread last night for
their supper. Oh that I had put it in! then would
not Abdallah have dared to let my lord be murdered
in his presence; he would have been compelled to
defend him after eating his bread and salt. Wo is
me! wo is me!'"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>John Macgregor, while on the upper Jordan in his
canoe Rob Roy, was taken prisoner by the Arabs.
As he parleyed with the old shaykh in his tent, Macgregor
opened a box of fine salt and proffered a pinch
of it to his captor. The shaykh had never before seen
salt so white and fine, and, therefore, thinking it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
sugar, he tasted it. Instantly Macgregor put a portion
also into his own mouth, and with a loud, laughing
shout he clapped the old shaykh on his back.</p>

<p>The shaykh was dumbfounded. His followers wondered
what had happened. "'What is it?' all asked
from him. 'Is it sukker?' He answered demurely,
'La, meleh!' ("No, it's salt!") Even his home secretary
laughed at his chief." "We had now eaten salt
together," says Macgregor, "and in his own tent, and
so he was bound by the strongest tie, and he knew
it." The result was that Macgregor and his canoe
were carried back in triumph to the river, and speeded
on their way, while the people on the banks shouted
"salaams" to their brother in the covenant of salt.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Salt alone is a basis of an enduring covenant, but
bread alone is not so. Yet bread and salt may be
such a basis, because there is salt as well as bread
there. So commonly does salt go with bread that it
is the exception when they are not together. Our
English Bible asks, at Job 6: 6, "Can that which hath
no savor be eaten without salt?" But the Septuagint
reads: "Can bread be eaten without salt?"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In India it is much the same as in Arabia, Palestine,
and Persia. In the Mahabharata, the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
treasure-house of Hindoo wisdom, the covenant of
bread and salt finds specific recognition. When
Krishna urges the hero Karna to join with him in the
war against the Kauravas, he says to him: "If you
will accompany me and join the Pandavas, they will
all respect you as their elder brother, and exalt you
to the sovereignty." But Karna cannot be persuaded
to this treacherous course, although he knows that to
be true will cost him his life. "I have seen bad
omens," he says, "and I know I shall be slain; but I
have eaten the bread and salt of the Kauravas, and
I am resolved to fight on their side."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Again, when Yudhishthira asked permission of
Bhishma and Drona to fight against the Kauravas,
they granted his request, and at the same time said:
"We fight on the side of the Kauravas because for
many years we have eaten their bread and salt, or
otherwise we would have fought for you."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In Madagascar also the covenant of salt is known,
as in other parts of the East.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And thus on every
continent and on the islands of the sea.</p>

<h2>V<br />
SALT REPRESENTING BLOOD</h2>


<p>There are indications in the customs of primitive
peoples that "blood" and "salt" are recognized as
in some sense interchangeable in their natures, qualities,
and uses. And in this, as in many another matter,
the trend of modern science seems to be in the
line of primitive indications.</p>

<p>Peoples who have not salt available are accustomed
to substitute for it fresh blood, as though the essential
properties of salt were obtainable in this way. An
observant medical scientist, writing of his travels in
eastern Equatorial Africa, tells of the habit of the
Masai people of drinking the warm blood fresh from
the bullocks they kill; and this he characterizes as "a
wise though repulsive" proceeding, "as the blood
thus drunk provided the salts so necessary in human
economy; for the Masai do not partake of any salt in
its common form."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Similarly, Dr. David Livingstone noted the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
when he was among peoples who had difficulty in procuring
salt, fresh-killed meat seemed to satisfy the
natural craving for salt, while vegetable diet without
salt caused indigestion.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In portions of China, also,
where salt is not obtainable, or where it is too expensive
for ordinary use, the blood of pigs or fowls is
carefully preserved and eaten as if a substitute for salt.</p>

<p>Professor Bunge of Basel, who is quite an authority
in the realm of physiological and pathological chemistry,
speaking on the relation of salt and blood, says
that "at every period, in every part of the world, and
in every climate, there are people who use salt as well
as those who do not. The people who take salt,
though differing from each other in every other respect,
are all characterized by a vegetable diet; in
the same way, those who do not use any salt are all
alike in taking animal food."</p>

<p>He says, moreover: "It is ... noteworthy that the
people who live on an animal diet without salt, carefully
avoid loss of blood when they slaughter the
animals. This was told me by four different naturalists
who have lived among flesh-eaters in various parts
of northern Russia and Siberia. The Samoyedes,
when dining off reindeer flesh, dip every mouthful in
blood before eating it. The Esquimaux in Greenland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
are said to plug the wound as soon as they have killed
a seal." Like testimony comes from India, Arabia,
Africa, Australia, and various parts of America.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The Jews of to-day, who are careful to drain the
blood from slaughtered animals prepared for food,
are accustomed to put salt freely on the meat thus
drained. This is in accordance with the prescription
of the Talmud, for the purpose of absorbing the blood
not drawn out from the main bloodvessels. At the
close of two hours from the slaughtering, the meat is
washed for cooking. Whatever be the reason rendered
for this application of salt, and its remaining on
the flesh for a time, may there not thus be an instinctive
supplying of the salts taken away by draining
out the blood?</p>

<p>"Salt" and "salts" are terms often used interchangeably
in the common mind. While they are distinct as
employed by a scientist, it is not to be wondered at
that they are confused by those who fail to note the
differences; nor is it important to consider these
differences in primitive thought and customs.</p>

<p>"A salt," as the chemists use the term, is a combination
of an acid and a base. There are many salts
in use in the world; among these the one best known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and most widely used and valued is sodium chloride,
or what is popularly known as "common salt." This
has been used and prized, the world over, among all
classes of men, from the earliest historic times.</p>

<p>Salt has long been popularly claimed as an important
element of the liquids of the body, as shown
in the blood, in the tears, and in the perspiration, of
mankind. Later scientific experiments have confirmed
ancient and traditional claims, that saline
injections avail like blood transfusion for the preservation
of life in an emergency.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>It has long been common among ordinary people to
administer salt to one taken with a hemorrhage of the
lungs, or stomach, or nose. This is the folk-lore
remedy in many regions. Moreover, under careful
medical and surgical direction it is now customary in
the hospitals to keep on hand a warm solution of salt
to inject into the veins or tissues of persons brought
in sinking from a sudden loss of blood. Whatever
connection the two ideas&mdash;the popular and the scientific&mdash;may
or may not have, it is not to be wondered
at that it has long been thought that, when blood has
gone out from the body, salt might well go in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Blood transfusion, by which the blood or life of a
stronger or fresher person may permeate the being of
a sinking one, has been known of for centuries, and
there are at least traces of it in tradition from the
earliest ages.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> More recent experiments have shown
that a saline solution is even safer and more efficacious
than the warm blood from another life; now, therefore,
this has largely taken the place of blood in supplying
the waste occasioned by severe hemorrhages.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Various
illustrations of this treatment are given as showing that
when persons were in a very low condition through
loss of blood, they have been rescued and restored
through copious injections of a saline solution.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The use of blood as food was forbidden to Noah
and his sons after the Flood.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> A tradition of the
Turkish or Tatar nations says that Noah's son Japheth
was their immediate ancestor, and that Toutug, or
Toumuk, a grandson of Japheth, discovered salt as an
article of diet by accidentally dropping a morsel of
food on to salt earth, and thus becoming acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
with the savor of salt.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This carries back the traditional
discovery of salt to the age when blood was
first forbidden as food.</p>

<p>It was long ago claimed by some that the red corpuscles
of the blood are dependent for their color and
vitality on the presence of salt, and recent scientific
experiments and discussion have continued in the
direction of the question thus raised.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>It has been shown by experiment that many of
the lower animals, as well as man, are dependent for
their life on salt in their blood. "When an animal is
fed with a diet as far as possible free from salts, but
otherwise sufficient, it dies of <i>salts-hunger</i>. The blood
first loses inorganic material, then the organs. The
total loss is very small in proportion to the quantity
still retained in the body; but it is sufficient to cause
the death of a pigeon in three weeks, and of a dog
in six, with marked symptoms of muscular and nervous
weakness."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> A mode of torture in former ages is
said to have been to deprive a person of salt, and cause
him to waste away with painful salt-hunger. It is said
that this mode of torture is still employed in China.</p>

<p>An Armenian story says that when a band of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
people was in a stronghold of the mountains, and was
besieged by the Turks, the latter failing to subdue the
former by other means cut off the supply of salt from
the Armenians, and this quickly subdued them.</p>

<p>In 1830, a paper by Dr. W. Stevens, read before
the London College of Physicians, and afterwards
elaborated and published in a volume, contended that
the salient ingredients of the blood, "the chief of which
is common culinary salt, ... is the cause of the red
color, of the fluidity, and of the stimulating property, of
the vital current." Dr. Stevens claimed that the poison
of the rattlesnake, and various other poisons, operate
directly on the blood, and produce disease or death
"by interfering with the agency of the saline matter."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>"On the subject of the poison of the rattlesnake,"
Dr. Stevens, in this work, asserts that "when the
muriate of soda (common salt) is immediately applied
to the wound, it is a complete antidote. 'When
an Indian,' he says, 'is bitten by a snake, he applies
a ligature above the part, and scarifies the wound to
the very bottom; he then stuffs it with common salt,
and after this it soon heals, without producing any
effect on the general system.'" In view of the fact
that it might be objected that the salt is not the
essential means of cure, but is an addition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
curative treatment, Dr. Stevens says that he has "seen a
rabbit, that was under the influence of the rattlesnake
poison, drink a saturated solution of muriate of soda
with great avidity, and soon recover; while healthy
rabbits would not taste one drop of the same strong
saline water when it was put before them."</p>

<p>Dr. Stevens gives various illustrations, out of primitive
customs, and in the experience of modern practitioners,
of curative and prophylactic uses of salt in
the treatment of fevers, where the condition of the
blood seems to be a main source of evil. Aside from
the question whether the claims of Dr. Stevens have
been substantiated by later researches and experiments,
his investigations and assertions are of interest
as showing that, in the realm of modern science as of
primitive practices, salt and blood have seemed to
many to have interchangeable values.</p>

<p>If, indeed, this theory of Dr. Stevens, elaborated so
carefully in the first third of the nineteenth century,
in which he claims that salt practically represents
blood, stood all by itself in the history of medicine, it
would have less importance than it has in a formal
treatise of this kind; yet even then it would show that
such an idea had before now found a place in the
human mind. But it by no means stands thus alone;
a similar claim has been made both earlier and later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Pliny, in his day, at the beginning of the Christian
era, records it as the common belief that salt is foremost
among human remedies for disease, and among
preventives of sickness of all kinds.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He gives prominence
to salt as a cure of leprosy,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> whereas blood
transfusion and blood bathing was the traditional treatment
of that disorder.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Pliny also speaks of salt itself,
and of salt fish in large quantities, as a supposed
remedy for the bite of serpents,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> this being in the line
of asserted remedies among the Indians, according to
Dr. Stevens. Various other disorders, especially of
the blood, are named by Pliny as curable by salt.</p>

<p>Seventy years after the treatise of Dr. Stevens, a
volume, recently published in London by C. Godfrey
Gümpel on "Common Salt,"<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> claims even more than
Pliny, or any writer since his day, for "the vital importance
of common salt for our whole physical and
social life." He claims that of all the constituents of
our life's blood "there is none which can possibly surpass
common salt in its necessity for a strong healthy
blood,"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and that both the red corpuscles and the
white are largely dependent for their normal condition
on "the presence of common salt in the system."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>A writer in the Asiatic Quarterly Review, not long
ago declared that the government salt monopoly of the
British Empire in India (since practically abolished,
or modified) was a cause of greater evils than those
resulting from either opium or alcohol. This claim
is based on the idea that a lack of salt by the common
people of India tends to a deterioration of
blood and consequent loss of life. Asiatic cholera is
said to be promoted by the lack of salt in the blood.
Men and cattle alike are said to be sufferers from this
cause, and the soil is rendered less fertile. Whether
this idea is well grounded is a minor matter; that the
idea has been in many minds is not to be questioned.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that in the primitive mind salt
and blood have seemed to have common properties,
and to be in a sense interchangeable, while the more
careful observers in the world of science have rather
grown toward this thought than away from it. Be it
correct or incorrect, the human mind has never been
able to rid itself of the idea.</p>

<p>Salt is sometimes used in the rite of blood brotherhood
among primitive peoples, as is also wine, both
wine and salt being counted the equivalent of blood,
and the original and the substitute being sometimes
employed together as if to intensify the symbolism.
Stanley tells of the use of salt in this rite on the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of its performance with Ngalyema in the Congo
region.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> And so again in other cases.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>It is a common practice in the East to welcome
an honored guest to one's house by sacrificing an
animal at the doorway, and letting its blood pour out
on the threshold, to be stepped over by the guest, as
a mode of adoption, or of covenant-making.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> When
such a guest comes unexpectedly, and there is not
time to obtain an animal for the welcoming sacrifice,
it is customary to take salt and strew it in lieu of
blood on the threshold,&mdash;salt being thus recognized as
the equivalent, or as a representative, of blood.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The measure of love and honor accorded to the welcomed
guest is indicated by the cost or preciousness
of the sacrifice on the threshold. There are traditions,
at least, of the sacrifice of a son of the host in this way.
Again a favorite horse has been thus sacrificed. More
frequently it is a lamb that is the sacrifice. If there
is no lamb available, a fowl or a pigeon is thus offered.
The essential factor in every case is the blood, the
life, outpoured. If, however, no actual blood is obtainable,
salt, as representing blood, is accepted as
indicating the love and the spirit which prompts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
welcome, according to the giver's means. There
could hardly be a fuller proof of the identity of salt
and blood in the primitive mind.</p>

<p>When a Siamese student was asked by the writer
whether the rite of blood-covenanting was known in
his land, he replied: "There is no 'blood covenant'
so far as I know. The custom is, if two persons are
desirous to become firm friends or brothers they drink
together <i>salted water</i>; then each takes an oath."
He also suggested that he had heard that in former
times they drank <i>a fowl's blood</i> in this rite.</p>

<p>Again, the mode of making a covenant of salt in
some portions of the East coincides with this suggested
identification of salt with blood in the primitive
mind. In the Lebanon region, where the blood
covenant, as a bond of union, is still recognized and
practised,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> the covenant of salt is also well known, not
only as between new comers who are to enter into a
mutual alliance, but as bringing into union friends
who would be as one. In such cases a sword is taken,
and salt is laid on its blade. The two friends in turn
lick of the salt that is to unite them, as if they were
tasting of common blood after the fashion of the
"blood-lickers" in Mecca.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Another illustration of this mode is given by Sir
Frederick Henniker, in his notes of a journey in the
East in 1819-20.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It was a shaykh of the Arabs
who escorted him from Mt. Sinai northward, who
cut this covenant with Sir Frederick. On the request
being made for such an assurance of fidelity from
the shaykh, "he immediately drew his sword," says
Sir Frederick, "placed some salt upon the blade,
and then put a portion of it into his mouth, and desired
me to do the same; and 'Now, cousin,' said he,
'your life is as sacred as my own;' or, as he expressed
himself, 'Son of my uncle, your head is upon
my shoulders.'" Before this act the two were as
cousins; now they were as one, the head of one being
upon the shoulders of the other. The similarity of
this rite with that of the blood covenant, in both its
form and meaning, is obvious.</p>

<p>This correspondence of salt and blood in primitive
thought, and in fact, will perhaps throw light on a
disputed reference in a fragment of Ennius<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> to "<i>salsus
sanguis</i>" (salted blood, or briny blood). It would
seem that as the Jews held that the blood is the life,
and the life is in the blood, similarly Greeks and Romans
recognized the truth that salt is in the blood,
and the blood is salt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>In the second century there were Christian ascetics
who refused to take wine in the eucharist. Among
these the Elkesaites and the Ebionites employed bread
and salt instead of bread and wine. This seems to
have been a recognition of the fact that salt, like wine,
represented blood.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Professor Hermann Collitz, of Bryn Mawr, has
suggested, in this connection, that the very words, in
Latin, for salt and blood, <i>sal</i> and <i>sanguis</i>, are from the
same root.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Certainly salt is sometimes used as a substitute for
blood in primitive covenanting; on the other hand,
blood is used for salt among some primitive peoples
as an essential accompaniment of food. These facts
being noticed by the author of this volume first suggested
to him the real meaning of the covenant of salt.</p>

<h2>VI<br />
SALT REPRESENTING LIFE</h2>


<p>As blood is synonymous with life in primitive
thought and practice,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and as salt has been shown to
represent blood in the primitive mind, so salt seems
to stand for life in many a form of primitive speech
and in the world's symbolism. When, indeed, we
speak of salt as preserving flesh from corruption, we
refer to the staying of the process of death by an
added element of life; preserving by re-vivifying,
rather than by embalming.</p>

<p>Plutarch says of the power of salt in this direction:
"All flesh is dead and part of a lifeless carcass; but
the virtue of salt being added to it, like a soul, gives
it a pleasing relish and poignancy."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> All life is from
the one Source of Life, and in this sense it is that life
is divine. Thus Plutarch calls attention to the fact
that Homer<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> speaks of salt as "divine," and that
"Plato delivers, that by man's laws salt is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
accounted most sacred."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> No other material is thus
reckoned from primitive days sacred and divine, unless
it be blood, which is the synonym of life.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>An Oriental form of oath sometimes substitutes
"salt" for "life;" as where the prime minister of
Persia in a conference with James Morier, secretary
of the English embassy, at Teheran, early in this
century, swore "by the salt of Fatti Ali Shah"&mdash;the
then reigning Shah of Persia.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Indeed, to swear "by
the salt" is a common form of asseveration among
Arabs; as to swear by the life, one's own or another's,
is a well-known oath in the East.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Where we would say of one who is foremost in
inspiriting and enlivening a social gathering, "He was
the <i>life</i> of the party," the Arabs say, "He was the
<i>salt</i> of the party."</p>

<p>The "salt of youth" is synonymous with the virility
and vigor of life, that show themselves in the age
of strong passion. Thus Justice Shallow says to
Master Page: "Though we are justices and doctors
and churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
our youth in us."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Iago refers to young gallants in
their passion, "as salt as wolves in pride."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> And
Menecrates refers to "salt Cleopatra" in her loves
with Antony.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Mrs. Browning seems to have a
similar idea as to the significance of salt, when she
says in "A Vision of Poets:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And poor, proud Byron,&mdash;sad as grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And salt as life; forlornly brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quivering with the dart he drave."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even in Plutarch's day this truth was recognized by
the Greeks as possibly having influenced the ancient
Egyptians to forbid salt to their priests, who must be
pure and chaste, because salt "by its heat is provocative
and apt to raise lust."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> It would seem, however,
that the prohibition of salt as food to Egyptian priests
is easier to be accounted for by the fact that it was
recognized as the equivalent of blood and life. Therefore
those priests were not to partake of salt, "no,
not so much as in their bread."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>In this line of thought Florus says of salt: "Consider
farther whether its power of preserving a
long time dead bodies from rotting be not a <i>divine</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
property, and opposite to death; since it preserves
part, and will not suffer that which is mortal wholly
to be destroyed. But as the soul, which is our diviner
part, connects the limbs of animals, and keeps the
composure from dissolution; thus salt applied to dead
bodies, and imitating the work of the soul, stops those
parts that were falling to corruption, binds and confines
them, and so makes them keep their union and
agreement with one another."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Philinus goes a step farther when he asks: "Do
you not think that that which is generative is to be
esteemed divine, seeing God is the principle of all
things?"<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And Plutarch adds suggestively that salt
is by some supposed to be a means of life, not only
exciting desire for generation, but actually causing
procreation; "the females (among the lower animals),
as some imagine, conceiving without the help of the
males, only by licking salt. But [as he thinks] it is
most probable that the salt raiseth an itching in
animals, and so makes them salacious and eager to
couple. And perhaps for the same reason they call
a surprising and bewitching beauty, such as is apt to
move and entice, <i>halmuron kai drimu</i>, 'saltish.'
And I think the poets had a respect to this generative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
power of salt in their fable of Venus springing
from the sea."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>In Central and South America it was deemed necessary
to abstain from salt while praying and sacrificing,
with a desire to obtain children. So far it was among
the Maya nations of the New World as among the
priests of Ancient Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>An Oriental proverb says: "If thou takest the salt
[the life, or soul] from the flesh [the body] then thou
mayest throw it [the flesh] to the dogs." This has
been explained by the rabbis, as considering "salt"
here synonymous with the soul, or life, of man, which
comes from God, in distinction from man's body,
which comes from his parents. "God gives the spirit
[the breath], the soul, the features, the hearing, the
organs of speech, the gait, the perceptions, the reason,
and the intuition. When now the time comes for
man to depart out of the world, God takes his part,
and the part which comes from the parents [the
body] he lays before them."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>When Elisha, the prophet of Israel, was met by
the men of Jericho, as he came from the scene of
Elijah's translation to enter upon his mission as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
successor of Elijah and was told of the death-dealing
power of the waters of the city, his words and
action seemed to emphasize the correspondence of salt
with life. "He said, Bring me a new cruse, and put
salt therein. And they brought it to him. And he
went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt
therein, and said, Thus saith the Lord, I have healed
these waters; there shall not be from thence any more
death or miscarrying [of the land]. So the waters
were healed [were restored to life] unto this day, according
to the word of Elisha which he spake."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>A spring of water is in itself so important to a
primitive people that it is not to be wondered at that
water is called the Gift of God, and that a living
spring is looked at as in a sense divine, and that it
has even been worshiped as a god among primitive
peoples.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> When, therefore, salt, as the synonym of
life or of blood, is found in a spring of living water, it
is natural to recognize the spot as peculiarly favored
of God, or of the gods. Thus "among inland peoples
a salt spring was regarded as a special gift of the gods.
The Chaonians in Epirus had one which flowed into a
stream where there were [as in the Dead Sea] no fish;
and the legend was that Heracles had allowed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
forefathers to have salt instead of fish (<i>Aristotle</i>). The
Germans waged war for saline streams, and believed
that the presence of salt invested a district with peculiar
sanctity, and made it a place where prayers were
most readily heard (Tacitus, <i>Ann.</i>, XIII., 57)."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>There is said to be a salt lake in the mountain
region of Koordistan, which was changed from fresh
water to salt, by St. Peter, when he first came thither
preaching Christianity. He wrought this change so
that he could influence the people to accept his teaching
through sharing his life by partaking of the salt. To
this day the tradition remains, that, if the natives will
bathe in that lake, they will renew their faith. Aside
from the question of any basis of truth in the legend,
it remains as a survival of the primitive idea of a real
connection of shared salt with shared life.</p>

<p>It is customary among some primitive peoples to
anoint or smear a new-born babe with blood, as a
means of giving him more and fuller life.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Thus
among the ancient Caribs, of South America, "as
soon as a male child was brought into the world, he
was sprinkled with some drops of his father's blood;"
the father "fondly believing that the same degree of
courage which he had himself displayed, was by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
means transmitted to his son."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In one of the Kaffir
tribes of South Africa, when a new chief assumes
authority, it was customary to wash him in the blood
of a near relative, generally a brother, who was put
to death on the occasion. In order to give more life
and character to the freshly elevated representative of
the ruling family, the family life was drawn from the
veins of one near him, in order that it might be absorbed
by him who could use it more imposingly.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The Bheels are a brave and warlike race of mountaineers
of Hindostan. They claim to have been,
formerly, the rulers of all their region, but either by
defeat in war or by voluntary concession to have
yielded their power to other peoples, whom they now
authorize to rule in their old domain. When, therefore,
a new rajput, or chief ruler, comes into power in
any of the surrounding countries, this right to rule is
conceded, or ratified, by an anointing of blood drawn
from the toe or thumb of a Bheel. The right of giving
this blood, or new life, is claimed by particular
Bheel families; and the belief that the individual from
whose veins the blood is drawn never lives beyond
a twelvemonth, in no degree operates to repress the
desire of the Bheels to furnish the blood of anointing.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>Salt is similarly used to-day, in the East and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
A new-born child is at once washed and
salted. If an Oriental seems lacking in life or wisdom,
or is, as we would say, exceptionally "fresh," it is said
of him, "He wasn't salted when he was born." This
idea would seem to be included in the prophet's reproach
of Jerusalem: "Neither wast thou washed in
water to cleanse thee; thou wast not salted at all,
nor swaddled at all."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>As at birth, so at death, salt seems to stand in
primitive thought for blood, or life, in washing or
anointing, in the hope of supplying the special lack or
need of the individual. Among the cannibals of
Borneo, on the death of a rajah or chief, the desire
seems to be to restore him to life if it be possible.
His body is rubbed or bathed with salt. He is then
dressed in his best apparel, and placed in a sitting
posture. In his hands are placed his shield and mandau.
If this application of new life and this special
appeal to action fail to arouse him, he is counted as
hopelessly dead; the arms are taken from him, the
body is undressed, and wrapped in a piece of cloth,
and placed in the ground.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>A traveler in Asia Minor speaks of the practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
among the Toorkomans of the mother's dipping a
child two or three times into a skin of salt water, at
the time of his naming. This would seem to be a
primitive rite, and not a Christian one. The father
of the child meanwhile eats honeyed cake, and drinks
thickened milk.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Milk is sometimes accepted by the Arabs as a substitute
for salt, as the essential factor in the covenant
of salt (the <i>milha</i>).<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Milk is nature's life food, it
stands for liquid life; two "milk brothers" are somewhat
as blood brothers, brothers by a common life.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
"There seem to be indications," says W. Robertson
Smith,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> "that many primitive peoples regard milk as
a kind of equivalent for blood as containing a sacred
life. Thus to eat a kid seethed in its mother's milk
might be taken as an equivalent to eating 'with the
blood,' and be forbidden to the Hebrews<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> along with
the bloody sacraments of the heathen."</p>

<p>Milk has been employed instead of blood, and
again of salt, for transfusion in case of declining life
from hemorrhage.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> This would seem to justify the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
belief that milk and blood alike represent life in
popular thought.</p>

<p>A favorite experiment among young folks is to
bring life to dead flies by covering them with salt.
When flies are drowned purposely, or by accident, if
one is taken from the water apparently dead, and laid
on the table, or on a plate, and covered with common
salt, in a few seconds the fly will creep out from under
the salt, and soon fly away as if unharmed. Other
flies in the same condition, not treated with salt, remain
as dead. This has been tried by succeeding
generations of young folks, and it is one of the folk-lore
facts in support of the idea that salt is life.</p>

<p>It may, of course, be that the absorbent power of
salt clears the trachea of the fly, and thus permits the
restoration of the natural breathing. Of course, there
is some explanation of the phenomenon; but the fact
remains that the common mind has been affected by
such things in the direction of the belief that salt is
life in a peculiar sense.</p>

<p>After the foregoing pages were already in type,
it was cabled as news from London that an English
mechanic claimed to have discovered a method of resuscitating
persons who have been drowned. He proposed
to cover the entire body of the person taken
from the water with dry salt, which is supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
absorb the moisture, and thus draw the water from the
lungs and permit the air again to circulate freely. He
claimed to have revived a recently drowned cat, after
letting it remain under salt for thirty minutes; and
that a drowned dog was thus restored in two hours.</p>

<p>This is simply the folk-lore idea of bringing the
dead to life by the application of salt as life. Like
many another folk-lore idea, it is deserving of attention
because of some possible basis of truth below the
idea, apart from the question of fact in connection
with the claim.</p>

<p>In "The Barber's Story of his Fifth Brother," in
"The Arabian Nights," is an account of the hero's
being beaten and slashed until he was supposed to be
dead from loss of blood, and his other injuries. Then
a slave-girl, named El-Meleehah, the "salt-bearer,"
came and stuffed salt into his gaping wounds, after
which his supposed corpse was thrown into a subterranean
vault among the dead. Yet by means of this
application of salt he was saved to life, and regained
his pristine vigor.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The references of Jesus to salt would seem to have
fuller meaning, if "salt" be understood as equivalent
to "life." Where he says to his disciples: "Ye are
the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot
of men,"<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> he would seem to remind them that they
are the life of the world, if, indeed, they retain life in
themselves. And where he says, "Have salt in yourselves,
and be at peace one with another,"<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> he would
call them to have life in themselves, and to join
with others who have it, in making their life to be
felt among their fellows.</p>

<p>A supposed utterance of Jesus, which has been a
puzzle to critics and commentators, possibly has light
thrown on it in this view of salt as corresponding with
life. Discoursing on life, and the wisdom of striving
to attain or to enter into life, even at a loss of much
that man might value here on earth, Jesus, according
to some manuscripts, said, "For every one shall be
salted with fire."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> This sentence is disputed by some,
not being found in all the more ancient MSS., and its
meaning does not seem to be clear to any.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> It is obvious
that whatever else "salted" here means, it does
not mean "salted." To salt is to mingle, or to accompany,
with salt. Clearly, fire does not do that. The
Greek is as vague, or as ambiguous, as the English.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
There must be a conventional or popular, a figurative
or symbolical, meaning in which "salt" is here used.
What can this be?</p>

<p>"Fire" is here spoken of as the synonym, or
equivalent, or parallel, of "salt." In this figure, <i>fire</i>
is to accomplish what <i>salt</i> performs; the work of <i>salt</i>
is to be done by <i>fire</i>. In what sense can this be true?
Fire does consume and destroy the perishable;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> it
does bring out and refine that which is permanent and
precious;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> it does try and test and reveal the measure
of real value in that which is submitted to it.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> In the
testing time, "each man's work shall be made manifest:
for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed
in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man's work,
of what sort it is. If any man's work shall abide
which he built thereon [on the one Foundation], he
shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be
burned he shall suffer loss: but he himself [who has
builded] shall be saved; yet as through fire."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The whole context of the passage in Mark's Gospel
indicates that Jesus is speaking of <i>life</i>. He is showing
the way to attain to life. He points to the final
testing of life by fire. As salt is shown to correspond
with life, and as this seems to have been understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
by his hearers, would they not have seen that Jesus
was pointing out that the measure of life, or salt, the
reminder of God's covenant with his people, in every
one of them, would be revealed in the testing of fire?</p>

<p>It is, indeed, because salt represents life, that salt
was to accompany every sacrifice under the Jewish
dispensation. Not death, but life, was an acceptable
offering to God, according to the teachings of the
Bible, both in the Old Testament and the New.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
God wants "not yours, but you."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> This was emphasized
by priest and prophet in the history of the
Jewish people, earlier and later. Paul re-echoed this
primal thought when he appealed to Christians: "I
beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
God, to present your bodies [yourselves] a <i>living</i> sacrifice,
holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable
service."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Without salt, without the symbol of
life, no sacrifice was to be counted a fitting or acceptable
offering at God's altar.</p>

<p>Salt is taken, in the world's thought, as an equivalent
of wit, or lively wisdom, in speech. Thus Paul
counsels the Colossian Christians: "Let your speech
be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may
know how ye ought to answer each one."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the Athenians were noted for their life and wit in
speech, "Attic salt" was a synonym of truest life in
conversation. Cicero says of Scipio: "<i>Scipio omnes
sale superbat</i>" ("Scipio surpassed all in salt," or
"wit").</p>

<p>Pliny after describing the properties and uses of
salt, says: "We may conclude then, by Hercules!
that the higher enjoyments of life could not exist
without the use of salt: indeed, so highly necessary
is this substance to mankind, that the pleasures of the
mind, even, can be expressed by no better term than
the word 'salt,' such being the name given to all
effusions of wit. All the amenities, in fact, of life,
supreme liberty, and relaxation from toil [in a word,
'life,'] can find no word in our language to characterize
them better than this."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Pliny also calls attention to the fact that "salarium,"
from which we derive our word "salary," was the
"salt money," bestowed as a reward or honorarium
on successful generals and military tribunes.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The
idea of a "living," or a support of life, is in the word
"salary." And so when we say that a man is "not
worth his salt," we mean that he is not worth his
living.</p>

<p>Salt has been employed as money at various times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and in various lands, and thus has been the means of
supporting life. It has been so in Tibet and in India,
and in the heart of Africa along from the sixth to the
nineteenth centuries of our era. Thus even in lands
where gold is abundant but less valued than salt.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>It is said of the people of a province in Tibet, that,
while they reckon the value of gold by weight, the
nearest approach to coined money which they have is
in molded and stamped cakes of salt. "On this
money ... the Prince's mark is printed; and no one
is allowed to make it except the royal officers....
Merchants take this currency and go to those tribes
that dwell among the mountains; ... and there they
get a <i>saggio</i> of gold for sixty, or fifty, or forty pieces
of this salt money; ... for in such positions they cannot
dispose at pleasure of their gold and other things,
such as musk and the like; ... and so they give them
cheap." "This exchange of salt-cakes for gold, forms
a curious parallel to the like exchange in the heart of
Africa, narrated by Cosmas in the sixth century, and
by Aloisio Cadamosto in the fifteenth."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Victor Hehn calls attention to the fact that "the
German copper-coin heller (haller or häller), the
smallest coin still in use in Austria, referred to in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the German saying, 'to have not a red heller,' derives
its name from the salt (<i>hal</i>), and the place where
it was obtained."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Pythagoras, speaking as usual in figurative terms,
described salt as a preserver of all things, as continuing
life and as staying corruption, or death. He
directed the keeping of a vessel of salt on every table,
as a reminder of its essential qualities.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Pliny says, moreover, that there are mountains of
salt in different countries in India, from which great
blocks are cut as from a quarry; and that from this
source a larger revenue is secured by the rulers than
from all their gold and pearls.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>In many countries of the world salt is a matter of
government control, its manufacture and disposition
being guarded as if life and death were involved in it.
It is a common saying in Italy that a man must not
dip up a bucket of water from the Mediterranean Sea;
for he might make salt from the water, and so defraud
the government.</p>

<h2>VII<br />
SALT AND SUN, LIFE AND LIGHT</h2>


<p>In Oriental and primitive thought Salt and Sun are
closely connected, even if they are not considered as
identical. They stand together as Life and Light.
Their mention side by side in various places tends to
confirm this view of their remarkable correspondence.
The similarity of their forms accords with the Oriental
delight in a play upon words, even apart from the
question of any similarity in their meanings.</p>

<p>Pliny, who, while not an original thinker, was a
faithful and industrious collater of the sayings and
doings of his contemporaries, and those who had gone
before him, especially in the realm of material things,
summed up the popular beliefs as to salt and its uses
in the declaration that there is nothing better for the
human body, in health or in sickness, than salt and
sun, "<i>sale et sole</i>."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Not only in the English and the Latin, but in the
Greek, the Kymric, and the Keltic, this similarity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the form of the words for salt and sun is to be observed.
The Greek <i>hals</i> and <i>helios</i>, the Welsh <i>hal</i>
and <i>haul</i>, the Irish <i>sal</i> and <i>sul</i>, illustrate this so far
as the form is concerned.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> As to the signification of
the words, it has already been shown that "salt"
represents "life" in primitive thought and speech.
Similarly the sun was considered "as the life-giver,
the emblem of procreation." In consequence, "son"
and "sun" are from the same root.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In view of this
it is not strange that salt and sun, as life and light, were
considered in primitive and popular thought as the
means of health and hope for mankind.</p>

<p>"The root of the word for salt is unknown. The
name of the sun is apparently a derivation from the
root <i>su</i> (or <i>s&#275;v)</i> 1. To generate. 2. To impel, to set in
motion, to bring about."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> If the same be not the root
of the word "salt," there is at least reason for thinking
that the meaning of the two words "salt" and "sun"
are similar,&mdash;one gives life, the other represents life.</p>

<p>To the primitive mind it certainly would seem
natural to ascribe the creation of salt to the action or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
power of the sun. Peculiarly would this be the case
with dwellers by the ocean or sea, or inland salt lakes.
As the sun shines upon the water drawn from the sea
or lake, the water is evaporated and the salt remains.
This is the ordinary process of salt-making with all its
benefits in various countries to the present day. What
thought is more natural, in view of this recognized
fact, than that the sun is the generator, or the begetter,
of salt which is life? If the sun is supposed to
bring life, in what way does it more directly accomplish
this than by this salt creation?</p>

<p>This would seem to give added significance and
force to the words of Jesus as to salt and light. If
in the days of Jesus it was held, as Pliny says, that there
was nothing that could help the life of humanity like
salt and sun, life and light, the disciples of Jesus
must have recognized a peculiar meaning in the teachings
of the Great Physician as he sent them out into
the world to heal the sick, and raise the dead, and
cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> when he
suggested that it was what they were, rather than what
they did, that was to be the help of humanity. In
the same teaching he said, "Ye are the salt of the
earth," "Ye are the light of the world."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The recognized meaning of these words in the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of Jesus intensified their importance at every use of
them, as when it was said that "in Him was life; and
the life was the light of men."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Salt was blood;
blood was life; salt was life; life was light; blood and
salt and light were life.</p>

<p>Among folk-lore customs on both sides of the ocean,
salt and a candle are carried across the threshold on
moving to a new house, as if representing life and
light as needs in a new home. Sometimes the Bible
also is included, as if in recognition of the true basis
of all sacred covenanting. There are other folk-lore
customs connecting salt and light.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>According to Professor Dr. Hilprecht, in the old
Assyrian language, <i>[t.]âbtu</i>, "salt," and <i>[t.]âbtu</i>, "blessing,"
have the same ideogram, and are written exactly
alike. "This suggests the inquiry whether they are
not derived from the same root, <i>[t.]âbu</i>, 'to be good,'
and whether <i>[t.]âbtu</i>, 'salt,' was not so called by the
Assyrians as the great blessing given to man, as
needed more than aught else for the preparation of
food and the preservation of life."</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
SIGNIFICANCE OF BREAD</h2>


<p>Bread is the basis of a common meal, as blood is
the basis of a common life. As, in the sacrifices, the
body of the animal offered in sacrifice was the basis
of a covenant meal, while the blood was the basis of
union with the divine; so in the symbolism of bread
and wine, in any sacramental meal, or in any meal of
sacred covenanting between two persons, the bread
stood for the flesh, and the wine for the blood. So,
also, when bread and salt are used together, the salt
would seem to stand for blood or life, and the bread
to stand for the flesh or the body.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>Blood gives life; flesh as food gives sustenance.
Salt represents life; bread represents sustaining food.
In this light those who share salt together are in a life-sharing
covenant; those who share bread together are
sharers in a common growth. Covenant union in
sacrifice is secured or consummated by blood-sharing;
it is evidenced or celebrated by food-sharing.</p>

<p>"Milk and honey" seem to be a symbol of blood
and flesh, or of salt and bread, from a divine source.
They are supplied to man from the vegetable world,
through the agency of living animals, by the power of
the Author of life. They stand for the vivifying and
nourishing of the body by a providential ministry to
man. In this light they seem to be viewed by primitive
peoples. The Land of Promise was represented
to the ancient Hebrews as "a land flowing with milk
and honey,"<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and this figure seemed to represent to
them all that could be desired in the line of God's
ministry to their material needs. It was many times
repeated to them, or by them, in this sense.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>This symbolism was preserved by the early Christians
in connection with the rite of baptism. Tertullian
describing that rite says: "Having come out
from the bath, we are anointed with a blessed unction
of holy oil;" afterwards "we first taste a mixture
of honey and milk."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<h2>IX<br />
SALT IN SACRIFICES</h2>


<p>Salt seems to have been recognized as a vital element
in sacrifices both in the teachings of the Bible
and in the customs of the pagan world. In the Lord's
injunction to Israel, it is said unqualifiedly: "And
every oblation of thy meal offering shalt thou season
with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the
covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal
offering: with all thine oblations [offerings bloody
or unbloody] thou shalt offer salt."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>An alternative reading of the words of Jesus in
Mark's Gospel refers to this custom when it says that
"every sacrifice shall be salted with salt."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Josephus,
in his "Antiquities of the Jews," makes reference to the
large quantities of salt required for sacrifices.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> This
corresponds with the provision of the King of Persia
for Jewish sacrifices, "salt without prescribing how
much,"<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>&mdash;a limitless or indefinite amount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Hebrew text which the Septuagint translators
had before them, salt is represented as always on
the table of shewbread, and as an important factor in
that memorial offering before the Lord. It reads:
"And ye shall put upon the pile [of bread] pure
frankincense and salt, and they shall be to the bread
for a memorial lying before the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Philo
Judæus makes mention of this salt with the bread,
on the sacred table in the Holy Place, and refers to
the salt as a symbol of perpetuity.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>In the directions for the preparation of the holy
incense for use by the priests in the services of the
tabernacle, the fragrant gums and spices were to be
"seasoned [or tempered together] with salt, pure and
holy."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> And this incense was for sacrificial offering.</p>

<p>It is still a custom among strict Jews to observe the
rite of the covenant of salt at their family table, before
every meal. The head of the house, having invoked
the Divine blessing in these words, "Blessed be thou
O Lord our God, King of the universe, who causest
bread to grow out of the earth," takes bread and
breaks it in as many pieces as there are persons present.
Having dipped each piece into salt, he hands a
portion in turn to every one, and they share it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
together. In cases where there is less strictness of
ritual observance on the part of modern Jews, this
ceremony is limited to the beginning of the Sabbath,
at the Friday evening meal.</p>

<p>This might seem to be merely a renewal of the
covenant which binds the members of the family to
one another and to God; yet it evidently partakes of
the nature of a sacrifice, and it is so understood by
the more orthodox Jews. The primitive idea of an
altar was a table of intercommunion with God, or with
the gods. It was thus with the Babylonians, the
Assyrians, the Egyptians, the Hindoos, the Persians,
the Arabs, the early inhabitants of North and South
America, and with primitive peoples generally.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Thus
also the Bible would seem to count an altar and a
table as synonymous. The prophet Malachi reproaches,
in God's name, the Jews for irreverence and
sacrilege. "And ye say, Wherein have we despised
thy name? Ye offer polluted bread upon mine <i>altar</i>.
And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that
ye say, The <i>table</i> of the Lord is contemptible."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The Talmud emphasizes the home table of the Jew
as the altar before the Lord, to be approached in sacrifice
with the essential offering of salt. "As long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the Temple existed, the altar effected atonement, and
now it is for the table of each man to effect atonement
for him. It is for this reason that the description
of the altar (in Ezekiel 41: 22) closes by saying,
'And he said unto me, This is the table that is before
the Lord.'"<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, that bread and salt are as
the body and the blood, the flesh and the life, offered
in sacrifice at the home table of the Jew, as formerly
at the altar of intercommunion with God.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>This view of the household table as an altar has
been recognized by many Jews. Picart<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> says:</p>

<p>"The German Jew sets bread and salt upon his
table, but the loaf, if possible, must be whole. He
cuts it without making a separation, takes it up with
both his hands, sets it down upon the table, and
blesses it. His guests answer, Amen. Afterwards he
rubs it with salt, and whilst he is eating it is as silent
as a Carthusian. The bread thus consecrated is distributed
to all who are at table. If he drinks wine,
he blesses it as he did the bread before; takes it in
his right hand, lifts it up, and pronounces the benediction
over it; and all other drink, water alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
excepted, is consecrated in the same manner. The
master of the family concludes with Psalm 23, and
then every one eats what he thinks convenient, without
further ceremony. The ceremony of cutting the
loaf without separation has the same reason to support
it; and a passage from Psalm 10: 3 is a voucher
for its solidity. The master of the house holds the
bread in both his hands, in commemoration of the
ten precepts relating to corn; and each finger is
the representative of one of them.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>"The salt as the religious intention of it is typical
of the ancient sacrifices. Meat without salt has no
savor, which is proved from a passage in Job, chapter
6, verse 6.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> This is civil policy confirmed by religion.</p>

<p>"A modest deportment at table is much recommended;
so likewise is temperance and sobriety.
Their bread must be kept in a very neat place, and
preserved with all imaginary care. They must talk
but little, and with discretion at table, because, according
to the opinion of the rabbis, the prophet
Elijah, and each respective guest's guardian angel, are
present at all meals. Whenever that angel hears anything
indecent uttered there, he retires, and a wicked
one assumes his place. They never throw down bones
of flesh or fish upon the ground; but, however, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
caution is not the result of cleanliness only, but fear,
lest they should hurt any of those invisible beings.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>"The knife that cuts their meat, must never touch
what is made of milk;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> whatever, in short, strikes the
senses in any manner, must be blessed. They never
rise from the table without leaving something for the
poor; but the knives must be removed before they
return thanks, because it is written, 'Thou shalt set no
iron on the altar.' Now a table is the representative
of an altar, at saying grace before, or returning thanks
after meal."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>That the table was looked at as an altar among
ancient peoples, is to be inferred from various proverbs
and practices with reference to it. Thus one of the
symbolic sayings of Pythagoras is, "Pick not up what
is fallen from the table."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> A comment on this is,
that as the table was consecrated to divinities, whatever
fell from it was not to be restored, but to
be left, as was the gleaning of God's fields, for the
poor.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> When the Syrophoenician woman said to
Jesus, "Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the
crumbs which fall from their masters' table,"<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
spoke in recognition of this primitive truth, that the
crumbs from the table might be shared by whoever
hungered.</p>

<p>A usage in the early Latin Church would seem to
be in the line of the Jewish thought, that bread and
salt at the table are a sacrifice, or a sacrament; and
it would also appear to be in recognition of the fact
that salt stands for blood, or for life. The catechumens,
before they were privileged to share in the
Eucharist, were made partakers of the sacrament of
salt (<i>sacramentum salis</i>),&mdash;salt placed in the mouth,
accompanied by the sign of the cross, and by invocations
and exorcisms.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>St. Augustine, speaking of this sacrament, says:
"What they receive is holy, although it is not the
body of Christ,&mdash;holier than any food which constitutes
our ordinary nourishment, because it is a sacrament."
And, referring to its reception by himself,
he says: "I was now signed with the sign of the
cross, and was seasoned with his salt."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>In the Greek Church, salt is still deemed an essential
element of the Eucharistic bread. It is said, indeed,
that the salt "represents the life, so that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
sacrifice without salt is but a dead sacrifice." The
same is true of the Armenian and Syrian Christians,
and Alcuin refers to the fact that, in his day, certain
Christians in Spain insisted that salt should be put
into the bread for the Eucharist.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Salt is put into the mouth of an infant at its baptism,
in the Roman Church of to-day.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> In administering
the salt to the babe the priest says: "Receive
the salt of wisdom. May it be a propitiation for thee
to eternal life."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> All "holy water," in that church,
contains salt as an essential element.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> At the dedication
of a church, water mixed with ashes and salt is
employed for the sprinkling of the corners of the altar,
and other portions of the church; and the remainder
is poured out at the foot of the altar, where the sacrificial
blood was of old poured out in the Temple
offerings.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>In the Brâhmanas, of the Vedic literature, salt is
described as the one "sacrificial essence" which is
common to both sky and earth. In the ritual directions
for the "ceremony of establishing a set of sacrificial
fires, on the part of a young householder," the
sacrificer, under the guidance of the priests, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
described as proceeding to equip Agni, the fire, with its
proper equipments. He having brought water and
gold,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> it is said: "He then brings salt. Yonder sky
assuredly bestowed that (salt as) cattle on this earth:
hence they say that salt soil is suitable for cattle.
That salt, therefore, means cattle; and thus he
thereby supplies it (the fire) with cattle; and the latter
having come from yonder (sky) is securely established
on this earth. Moreover, that (salt) is believed to be
the savor (<i>rasa</i>) of those two, the sky and the earth;
so that he thereby supplies it (the fire) with the savor
of those two, the sky and the earth. That is why he
brings salt."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>According to the Brâhmanas, the first offered sacrifice
was a man. When "the sacrificial essence" went
out of the man in his offering, it went into the horse,
then into the ox, then into the sheep, then into the
goat. And afterwards it would seem to have been
represented in salt. So in bringing salt to the fire for
sacrifice, there are brought cattle, or animal offerings,
with their blood and their life.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>It is said in Brâhmanic explanation of the pre-eminent
value of salt as a sacrificial essence, that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
made thus by an original agreement between the sky
and the earth. "The sky and the earth were originally
close together. On being separated, they said to
each other, 'Let there be a common sacrificial essence
(ya-<i>gñ</i>-iyam) for us!' What sacrificial essence there
was belonging to yonder sky, that it bestowed on this
earth, that became the salt (in the earth), and what
sacrificial essence there was belonging to this earth,
that it bestowed on yonder sky, that became the black
(spots) in the moon. When he throws salt (on the
fire-place), let him think it to be that (<i>viz</i>: the black
in the moon): it is on the sacrificial essence of the sky
and the earth that he sets up his fire."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Among the Booddhists in China, where the sacrifices
are almost exclusively vegetable, salt and wine are
added in separate cups.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> This would seem to suggest
the symbolism of both blood and wine in the offerings.</p>

<p>Salt had its place in sacrifices in ancient Egypt.
Herodotus tells, for instance, of the great annual
festival at Saïs, in honor of the goddess Neith, corresponding
to Athena or Minerva. Neith was, in fact,
another presentation of Isis, and was known as "the
great mother of all life." In conjunction with the
sacrifices on this occasion, there was the Feast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Burning Lamps, when all the inhabitants burned, in
the open air, about their houses, lamps filled with oil
and salt. He says, moreover: "The Egyptians who
are absent from the festival [at Saïs] observe the rite
of the sacrifice, no less than the rest, by a general
lighting of lamps; so that the illumination is not confined
to the city of Saïs, but extends over the whole
of Egypt."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Wilkinson says of these lamps and their
contents: "The oil floated on water mixed with salt;"
and he suggests a correspondence of this custom with
a like one in India and in China.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Friedrich, in his "Symbolism of Nature," speaking
of this festival, says that the "salt symbolized the creation
of life, and the light that it came forth from darkness
into existence; therefore this did well suit the
festival." And a collector of Etruscan remains, referring
to the magic lamp still used in Italy, says,
in connection with these words of Friedrich, that the
"wick fire seemed so mysterious to the Rosicrucian
Lord Blaize that he wrote a book on it, and on the
blessed secrets of salt."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Salt was essential to a sacrifice among the ancient
Romans, as among the Hebrews. A cake made of
coarsely ground spelt, or wheat, mingled with salt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
was broken, or bruised, and sprinkled upon the head
of the victim for sacrifice, upon the fire of the altar,
and upon the sacrificial knife. Hence the term
"immolation," or sprinkling with this salted meal,
came to be synonymous with sacrificing.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Pliny, telling
of the priceless value of salt, says of it in conclusion:
"It is in our sacred rites, more especially, that
its high importance is recognized, no offering ever
being made unaccompanied by the salted cake [<i>sine
mola salso</i>]."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> And Ovid says, that "in days of old
it was plain spelt, and the sparkling grain of unadulterated
salt that had efficacy to render the gods propitious
to man."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>There is good reason for believing that it was much
the same with the Greeks as with the Romans, although
the fact that this is not distinctly declared in
the classic texts has led some modern scholars to call
it in question. Barley-meal cakes, with or without
salt, were certainly employed by the Greeks in their
sacrifices.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> And Homer speaks of salt as "divine."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
When, therefore, it is considered that salt was counted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
essential in sacrifices among the ancient Egyptians,
Hindoos, and Hebrews, as also later among the Romans,
it would seem to need proof to the contrary to
meet the natural presumption that the Greeks also made
use of "divine salt" in their sacred sacrificial cakes.</p>

<p>Salt was offered at every little shrine by the wayside
in Guatemala, in Central America, in olden time.
It was an acceptable gift to the gods.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Wellhausen, in treating of the remains of Arabian
paganism,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> tells of the custom of the old priests of
throwing salt into the fire of sacrifice, unperceived by
the worshiper as he appealed to the gods in his oath,
and of the consequent startling of the offerer by the
up-leaping flames, as though under a divine impulse.
Various popular sayings are cited as incidental proofs
of this custom; the purport of them all being that salt
in the fires of sacrifice is supposed to be an effective
appeal to the gods.</p>

<p>Pliny says that "salt, regarded by itself, is naturally
igneous, and yet it manifests an antipathy to fire, and
flies from it."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> This would seem to be a reference to
the tendency of salt to spring up, or flash and sparkle,
when thrown into the flames.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>It has indeed been suggested that the very name
"salt" was derived (through <i>saltus</i>, "to leap") from
the tendency of this substance "to leap and explode
when thrown upon fire."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> If there be any probability
in this suggestion, or in another, and more
natural one, that <i>saltus</i> was from the same root as <i>sal</i>,
"salt," it is easy to see that the primitive mind might
infer that such was the affinity of salt with the divine,
that, when offered by fire, it leaped toward heaven,
and so was understood to be peculiarly acceptable to
God or to the gods, in sacrifice. The Latin verb <i>salis</i>
has the twofold meaning "to salt" or "to sprinkle
before sacrifice," and "to leap, spring, bound, jump;"
and the root <i>sal</i> would seem to be in the Latin and
the Sanskrit alike.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Similarly, the word "salacious,"
or lustful, had this origin.</p>

<p>It is evident that the primitive popular mind recognized
salt as a peculiarly acceptable offering in sacrifice
to God or the gods, and that its very name in various
combinations seemed to suggest the aspiring or uprising
heavenward.</p>

<h2>X<br />
SALT IN EXORCISM AND DIVINATION</h2>


<p>The line between sacrificial offerings and offerings
for the purpose of exorcising evil spirits, or of propitiating
good spirits, is not always a clear line even
in the mind of the offerer; but there are uses of salt
among primitive peoples which must be placed under
the head of exorcisms and divinations, and as an
accompaniment of incantations, rather than under the
head of sacrifices, even though they may be only perversions
of the original idea of sacrifice.</p>

<p>Burckhardt tells of the burning of salt, by way of
exorcism, among the people of Daraon, on the borders
of Upper Egypt and Nubia. His caravan was about
being loaded for a journey. "Just before the lading
commenced," he says, "the Ababde women appeared
with earthen vessels in their hands, filled with burning
coals. They set them before the several loads, and
threw salt upon them. At the rising of the bluish
flame produced by the burning of the salt, they exclaimed,
'May you be blessed in going and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
coming!' The devil and every evil genius are thus, they
say, removed."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Among Muhammadan Arabs, in and out of Egypt,
salt is sprinkled on the floors of every apartment in
the houses, on the last night of the month of Ramadan,
accompanied by the words, "In the name of
God, the Compassionate, the Merciful!" This is because
the evil jinn, or genii, are supposed to be confined
in prison during that month, and the sprinkling
of salt, with the prescribed invocation, ensures protection
from them as they renew their work of harm.
Salt is also sprinkled on the floor after the birth of a
child, as a propitiatory offering for mother and child,
against the influence of the evil eye.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>In China, on the eve of the new year, salt is thrown
into the fire, and the manner of its burning is taken as
an indication, favorable or unfavorable, for the coming
year. It is a species of divination by salt.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In Japan,
the burning of salt, or the offering it in this way to
the gods, is a propitiatory sacrifice in time of danger;
and it is scattered at the threshold for a similar
purpose after a funeral.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> In Syria, also, the burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of a lump of salt in the fire is resorted to as a means
of exorcising the malevolent spirit which afflicts one
through the "evil eye."<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>While suspected persons, or persons of doubtful
orthodoxy, were undergoing the "ordeal of boiling
water" under ecclesiastical authority, in the Middle
Ages and earlier, it is said that "by way of extra precaution,
in some ritual it is ordered that holy water
and blessed salt be mingled in all the food and drink
of the patient&mdash;presumably to avert diabolical interference
with the result."<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Among the folk-lore customs in modern Greece
salt has prominence in various ways. Salt must be
pounded on certain days and in a certain way, in
order to guard against ill luck. Salt must never be
carried out of the house after dark.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland and in England, as well as in the East,
the use of burning salt in exorcism has continued
in the more primitive regions down to the present
century. James Napier tells, for example, of the
treatment to which he was subjected as a child, when
it was surmised that he had gotten "a blink of an ill
e'e." He says: "A sixpence was borrowed from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
neighbor, a good fire was kept burning in the grate, the
door was kept locked, and I was placed upon a chair
in front of the fire. The operator, an old woman,
took a tablespoon and filled it with water. With the
sixpence she then lifted as much salt as it could carry,
and both were put into the water in the spoon. The
water was then stirred with the forefinger till the salt
was dissolved. Then the soles of my feet and the
palms of my hands were bathed with this solution
thrice, and after these bathings I was made to taste
the solution three times. The operator then drew her
wet forefinger across my brow,&mdash;called 'scoring aboon
the breath.' The remaining contents of the spoon
she then cast over the fire, into the hinder part of the
fire, saying as she did so, 'Guid preserve frae a' skith.'
These were the first words permitted to be spoken
during the operation."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Mr. Napier adds that while
in his case the "scoring aboon the breath" was accomplished
by scoring with a finger wet with salt
water, the suspected possessor of an evil eye was
scored with the finger-nails, or some sharp instrument,
so as to draw blood. The blood and the salt seemed
to have correspondent values.</p>

<p>In the southern counties of England, salt is thrown
into the fire by way of invoking spiritual aid in behalf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of a lass who would win back a recreant lover. "A
pinch of salt must be thrown into the fire on three successive
Friday nights, while these lines are repeated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'It is not this salt I wish to burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is my lover's heart to turn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he may neither rest, nor happy be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until he comes and speaks to me.'"<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There seems to be a special value in the sacred
number "three," in the appeals through salt to the
spiritual powers. In the Scottish Lowlands, "when
a dead body has been washed and laid out, one of the
oldest women present must light a candle, and wave
it three times around the corpse. Then she must
measure three handfuls of common salt into an earthenware
plate, and lay it on the breast. Lastly she
arranges three 'toom,' or empty dishes, on the hearth,
as near as possible to the fire; and all the attendants
going out of the room return into it backwards, repeat
this 'rhyme of saining:'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Thrice the torchie, thrice the saltie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice the dishes toom for "loffie" (<i>i. e.</i>, praise),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These three times three ye must wave round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The corpse, until it sleep sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep sound and wake nane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till to heaven the soul's gane.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In connection with the putting of a plate of salt on
the breast of a dead body, there were various usages.
A plate of bread was sometimes set with the salt, and
again a plate of earth was its accompaniment. And
different reasons were assigned for the presence of the
salt there. Napier says that many persons claimed
for it a value in preventing the swelling of the body
in process of decomposition, "but its original purpose
was to act as a charm against the devil, to prevent
him from disturbing the body."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>"Pennant tells us that formerly, in Scotland, the
corpse being stretched on a board and covered with a
close linen wrapper, the friends laid on the breast of
the deceased a wooden platter, containing a small
quantity of salt and earth, separate and unmixed;
the earth an emblem of the corruptible body, the salt
as an emblem of the immortal spirit [the life]."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Napier adds: "There was an older superstition
which gave another explanation for the plate of salt
on the breast. There were persons calling themselves
'sin-eaters,' who, when a person died, were sent for to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
come and eat the sins of the deceased. When they
came, their <i>modus operandi</i> was to place a plate of
salt and a plate of bread on the breast of the corpse,
and repeat a series of incantations, after which they
ate the contents of the plates, and so relieved the
dead person of such sins as would have kept him
hovering around his relations, haunting them with
his imperfectly purified spirit, to their great annoyance,
and without satisfaction to himself."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The
basis of this plan of vicarious substitution of personality
would seem to be, in the entering of the "sin-eaters"
into oneness of life with the deceased through
the salt covenant or the blood covenant, in partaking
of his body and blood in the bread and salt from his
breast.</p>

<p>Leland, in his "Etruscan-Roman Remains in Popular
Tradition," says that there was, among the Tuscan
Romans, an incantation, or an invocation, for every
emergency. "If salt upset, they said, 'Dii avertite
omen!'"<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> In Sicily, a goddess known as the Mother
of the Day "is invoked when salt is spilt."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> He also
cites various incantations and exorcisms, in which salt
is an essential factor.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>A custom prevails in some portions of Pennsylvania,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
even to this day, of carrying a bag of salt,
with a Bible, over the threshold, on entering a new
house for the first time. There are families who
would not consent to live in a home which had not
been thus consecrated.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> This would seem to be a
survival of the passing over the threshold with an
offering of blood. A correspondence of this practice
with ancient Etruscan customs seems to be indicated
by the collections of Leland.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Among the Mordvins,
a Finnish people on the Volga, salt on bread is placed
under the threshold of the bride's paternal home at
the time of a marriage covenant.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> This may be
classed with sacrifices or with divination according
to our idea of the workings of the primitive Mordvin
mind.</p>

<h2>XI<br />
FAITHLESSNESS TO SALT</h2>


<p>The fact that in its primitive conception a covenant
of salt is a permanent and unalterable covenant,
naturally suggests to the primitive mind the idea of
treachery as faithlessness to salt. The Persian term
for a "traitor" is <i>namak harâm</i>, "untrue to salt,"
"one faithless to salt;"<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and the same idea runs
through the languages of the Oriental world.</p>

<p>Baron du Tott, referring to the sharing of bread and
salt, says: "The Turks think it the blackest ingratitude
to forget the man from whom we have received
food, which is signified by the bread and salt."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> But
it is obvious that it is faithlessness to salt, not to bread
or ordinary food, that is deemed blackest ingratitude.
This is in India, as in Turkey. Tamerlane, the
Mongol-Tatar chieftain, speaking, in his institutes, of
one Share Behraum, who had deserted his service for
the enemy and afterwards returned to his allegiance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
says: "At length my salt which he had eaten overwhelmed
him with remorse, he again threw himself on
my mercy, and humbled himself before me."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Frazer
quotes a rebel chief in India as saying, when he
capitulated after a siege, and was asked if he would
return to his old allegiance, "No, I can no more
visit my country; I must look for service elsewhere.
I can never face the rajah again; for I have eaten
Ghoorka salt. I was in trust, and I have not died at
my post. We can never return to our country."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Burton says that the Bed'ween of Arabia denounce
the Syrians as "abusers of the salt," because they
cannot be depended on in their agreements.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> And
Dr. Thomson says that Orientals "often upbraid the
civilized Frank because he does not keep bread and
salt, is not faithful to the covenant of brotherhood."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Burton says also, of the Bed'ween of El Hejaz:
"'We have eaten salt together" (<i>nahnu malihin</i>) is
still a bond of friendship: there are, however, some
tribes who require to renew the bond every twenty-four
hours, as otherwise, to use their own phrase, 'the
salt is not in their stomachs.'"<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> And he quotes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
advice to him of Shaykh Hamid, concerning the Bed'ween
who were to escort him from El Medinah,
"never to allow twenty-four hours to elapse without
dipping hand in the same dish with them, in order
that the party might always be 'malihin,' on terms of
salt."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Treachery on the part of one who has even
partaken of an ordinary meal with another is, however,
counted, among Orientals, a peculiar crime, as
surprising as it is unusual.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Of course, there is no human bond which will guard
human nature against all possible treachery. These
references to the measure of fidelity among different
peoples or tribes are an indication of the relative degree
of faithfulness prevailing among them severally.
Those who are faithless to salt cannot be depended
on for anything. If a man would not be true to one
who is of his own blood, of his own life, and to whom
he is bound in a sacred covenant of which his God is a
party, he could not be depended on in any emergency.
The covenant of salt is all this in the thought of the
primitive mind.</p>

<p>Don Raphel says, of the estimate of faithlessness to
salt entertained by Arabs generally: "When they
have eaten bread and salt with any one, it would be a
horrid crime not only to rob him, but even to touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the smallest part of his baggage, or of the goods which
he takes with him through the desert. The smallest
injury done to his person would be considered as an
equal wickedness. An Arab who should be guilty of
such a crime would be looked upon as a wretch who
might expect reproof and detestation from everybody.
He would appear despicable to himself, and never be
able to wash away his shame. It is almost unheard
of for an Arab to bring such disgrace upon himself."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>It was said by the ancient Jews that Sodom was
destroyed because its inhabitants had been faithless to
salt, in maltreating guests who had partaken of salt in
their city. In a Talmudic comment on Lot's wife,
the record is: "Rabbi Isaac asked, 'Why did she
become a pillar of salt?' 'Because she had sinned
through salt. For in the night in which the men
came to Lot she went to her neighbors, and said to
them, Give me salt, for we have guests. But her
purpose was to make (the evil-minded) people of the
city acquainted with the guests. Therefore was she
turned into a pillar of salt.'"<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>This idea of foul treachery as equivalent to faithlessness
in the matter of salt, seems to be perpetuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in Da Vinci's famous painting of the Last Supper,
where Judas Iscariot is represented as having overturned
the salt-cellar.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> And even among English-speaking
peoples the spilling of salt between two persons
is said to threaten a quarrel; as though they had
already broken friendship.</p>

<p>Gayton, describing two friends (who were proof even
against this ill sign), says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have two friends of either sex, which do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eat little salt, or none, yet are friends too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of both which persons I can truly tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are of patience most invincible,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When out of temper no mischance at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can put,&mdash;no, not if towards them the salt should fall."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In both the Old Testament and the New faithlessness
to a formal covenant is reckoned a crime of
peculiar enormity as distinct from any ordinary transgression
of a specific law. Transgressing a covenant
with the Lord is counted on the part of Israel much
the same as worshiping the gods of the heathen. This
is shown in repeated instances in the Old Testament.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
In the New Testament, Paul includes among
the grossest evil-doers of paganism those who are
"filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness,
maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife,
deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters, hateful to
God," and so down to "covenant-breakers," and
those "without natural affection," as among the lowest
and worst of all.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> This idea shows itself continually

<h2>XII<br />
SUBSTITUTE TOGETHER WITH REALITY</h2>


<p>Primarily it is the blood, as the life, of two persons
entering into a covenant with each other and with the
Author of life, that is the nexus of the enduring covenant.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Secondarily, it is the blood, or life, of a substitute
victim offered as a sacrifice to God, or to the
gods, that is accepted as such a nexus,&mdash;the blood
being shared by the contracting parties, or being
poured out as an oblation to God, and the flesh being
eaten conjointly by the parties covenanting.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Yet, again, wine is accepted as representing blood.
This is not only because wine resembles blood in
appearance, and is called in the Bible record the
"blood of the grape,"<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> but because wine is actually
deemed, by many primitive peoples, real blood,
and is supposed to affect its users as it does because
it represents the spirit, or life, of the divinity whose
blood it is.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> On this point Frazer calls attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the primitive views of Egyptians, Arabians, Aztecs,
and others, citing authorities from Plutarch to Robertson
Smith.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>He says, for example: "We are informed by Plutarch
that of old the Egyptian kings neither drank
wine nor offered it in libations to the gods, because
they held it to be the blood of beings who had once
fought against the gods, the vine having sprung from
their rotting bodies; and the frenzy of intoxication
was explained by the supposition that the drunken
man was filled with the blood of the enemies of the
gods. The Aztecs regarded <i>pulque</i>, or the wine of the
country, as bad, on the account of the wild deeds which
men did under its influence. But these wild deeds
were believed to be the acts, not of the drunken man,
but of the wine god by whom he was possessed and inspired....
Thus it appears that, on the primitive view,
intoxication, or the inspiration produced by wine, is
exactly parallel to the inspiration produced by drinking
the blood of animals.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The soul or life is in the
blood, and wine is the blood of the vine.... Whoever
drinks wine drinks the blood, and so receives
into himself the soul or spirit of the god of the vine."</p>

<p>Naturally, a substitute or representative of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
original, or real, nexus of a covenant, came to stand
for the primary article with such prominence in the
popular mind that it would be deemed an essential,
not only when the real was lacking, but while the real
was actually present. Therefore we find libations of
wine accompanying actual blood, in sacrifices,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> as well
as used in substitution for it; so also of other substitutes,
such as saffron water, milk, and coffee, at other
times.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>As salt represents blood and life, quite naturally
salt is employed in sacrifices, not only where there
is no blood or life, but also where there is. And
this accounts for the prominence of salt in sacrifices,
and elsewhere, where blood or life is essential as a
fitting offering, and as a bond of union.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Both wine
and salt as substitutes for blood are frequently used
together, as though one alone were not sufficient.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Similarly, bread is a recognized representative of
flesh. It is so understood in sacred and secular records
and traditions. When Jesus spoke of bread as his
flesh, and as his body,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and of the fruit of the vine as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
blood, he used terms that in his day, and earlier, were
known in popular thought as representing the truth
at the basis of the covenant by which two became one
in a merged common life.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Yet while bread was an
accepted substitute for flesh, it was much used as an
accompaniment of flesh<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> in sacrificial feasts. Thus
bread and salt as recognized substitutes for flesh and
blood came to be commonly used even where real
flesh and blood were the main factors in the sacrifice.
Substitutes for bread, such as honey and flour or meal,
were, as already shown, also used in connection with
bread. Hence it is not unnatural to find salt as blood
accompanying blood itself. This is entirely in accord
with primitive thought and customs generally.</p>

<h2>XIII<br />
ADDED TRACES OF THE RITE</h2>


<p>On the occasion of a sacred alliance between clans,
or in a treaty of peace at the close of a war, among
the Kookies of India, there is a formal appeal to the
gods, in which salt has an important part. A <i>dhar</i>, or
short sword, is placed on the ground between the two
parties. On it, as on an altar, "are arranged rice,
salt, earth, fire, and a tiger's tooth. The party swearing
takes the <i>dhar</i> and puts the blade between his
teeth, and, biting it, says, 'May I be cut with the
<i>dhar</i> in war and in the field; may rice and salt fail
me, my crops wither, and I die of hunger; may fire
burn all my worldly possessions, and the tiger devour
me, if I am not faithful!'"<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>Among the Battas, in Sumatra, the more solemn
form of their oath is, "May my harvest fail, my cattle
die, and may I never taste salt again, if I do not speak
the truth."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the Dyaks of Borneo, when a question
arises between disputants for which there is no ordinary
mode of settlement, each litigant is given a lump of
salt, which the two drop into water simultaneously,
and he whose lump dissolves soonest is adjudged the
loser.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>In the Kenyah tribe in Borneo, the ceremony of
naming a child is made much of. Guests assemble
on the occasion. After the more private ceremony,
participated in by a favored few, every guest present
is given a package of salt and some ginger root, as
wedding-cake is given in many lands, for a souvenir
of the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>A custom among Slavic peoples of presenting bread
and salt to a ruler at the threshold of his domain, as
he comes on a visit, would seem to combine the two
ideas of hospitality and of worship. When the Emperor
of Russia visits one of his provinces, or subject
cities, he is met at its threshold by its representative
rulers, as his loyal subjects, with bread and salt served
on a golden or a silver-gilt placque. In the Winter
Palace of St. Petersburg there are hundreds of these
suspended over the doorways and on the walls, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
placques were thus presented to different emperors
on the occasion of such visits.</p>

<p>When the Grand Duke Alexis visited America in
1872, he was received in this way by the wife of the
Russian Minister at Washington. "As the Grand
Duke entered the Legation, Madame de Catacazy
carried a silver salver on which was placed a round
loaf of plain black bread, on the top of which was imbedded
a golden salt-cellar."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> This was obviously
more than a symbol of welcome to the home of the
embassy. The Grand Duke came as a ruler and lord
to his own, and his own received him loyally, with
symbols of reverent submission. It was more like the
threshold covenant of the East, when blood is poured
out from an offered body at the doorway of a house,
as one who would be honored as well as welcomed
comes in.</p>

<p>Some years later there was an account in the London
Court Journal of the making in Paris of an ornate
golden dish for a similar use in Roumania. The
burghers of Bucharest were arranging to present on
this dish bread and salt to Princess Marie of Edinburgh,
when she should make her first entrance into
their city as their future queen. The dish was of gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
worked in a purely Renaissance design, its edge being
an openwork pattern of interlaced ears of corn and
branches of laurel. In the center was the salt-cellar,
shaped like an open tulip, and resting upon four
graceful stalks.</p>

<p>In the days of Queen Elizabeth of England it was
a custom of officials of the palace to rub bread and
salt on the plates of the dining-table before each royal
meal.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Among the Kookies of the Hill Tribes in India,
"whenever they send any message of consequence to
each other, they always put in the hand of the bearer
of it a small quantity of salt, to be delivered with the
message as expressive of its importance."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> This
would seem to indicate a life-and-death matter in the
message.</p>

<p>An old English custom of having a salt-cellar at a
certain point on the family table, and of seating those
present above or below it, gave rise to the phrase
"sitting below the salt" as indicative of an inferior
position at the household table. As salt was a symbol
of hospitality and of covenanted union, he who
was within the scope of salt-sharing at a table was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
a very different position from one who was outside
of it.</p>

<p>A reference to this custom by Sir Walter Scott, in
his "Tales of My Landlord," in the first quarter of
the nineteenth century, provoked much discussion,
and doubt was expressed as to the existence of the
custom in olden time. But abundant evidence was
produced as to its veritableness.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> An old English
ballad was cited, in which one said sneeringly to his
inferior:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou art a carle mean of degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye salte doth stand twain me and thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But an thou hadst been of ane gentyl strayne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wold have bitten my gant<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> aganie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And one of Bishop Hall's Satires, in 1597, was
instanced as saying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A gentle squire would gladly entertaine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into his house some trencher chaplaine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some willing man that might instruct his sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that would stande to good conditions.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, that he lie upon the truckle-bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whiles his young maister lieth o'er his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Second, that he do, on no default,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever presume to sit above the salt."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a custom in Oxford University to give salt to
a student who had concluded his course as a "freshman,"
and was finding admission into the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of maturer, or salter, students or sophisters. Drinking
salt and water, or salt and beer, was a part of this
ceremony. It was called "salting a freshman," or
"college salting."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>A series of plates, illustrative of certain student
ceremonies at Strassburg University was published in
1666. "The last [of these] represents <i>the giving of
the salt</i>,&mdash;which a person is holding on a plate in his
left hand, and with his right hand is about to put a
pinch of it upon the tongue of each <i>becanus</i>, or freshman.
A glass, probably holding wine, is standing
near him. Underneath is the following couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Sal Sophiæ gustate, bibatis vinaque læta,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Augeat immensus vos in utrisque Deus!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Hungary, at a wedding, there are customs that
give solemn emphasis to the truth that two lives are
newly made one in a sacred covenant. The ceremony
is presided over by the Vajda, or chief ruler,
rather than by any Christian ecclesiastic. He stands
with his back to a blazing fire as the primitive altar.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
When his address is concluded, an earthen vessel is
dashed to pieces as a symbol of their former life now
ended. Then the bridal couple are sprinkled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
salt and brandy, doubly standing for blood on the
threshold of their married life.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Bread and salt seem to have a peculiar sacredness
among the Hungarian gypsies. This incident, from a
gypsy camp, is given in a Hungarian newspaper: A
gypsy who had lost his cash informed his leader of the
fact, and at once an order was issued for its restoration.
The money not appearing, the gypsy chief bound
two poles into the form of a cross, and fixed one end
in the ground. On the top of the cross he fastened
a piece of bread, and sprinkled it with salt. Each
member of the band was then called to swear upon
this symbol that he had not committed the theft. All
stood the test, until the last one, an old woman, came
forward. As she was about to take the oath, she
turned pale, put her hand in her pocket, and brought
out the stolen money. She was then soundly beaten,
and kicked out of camp.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>The primitive idea that the sovereign properly controls
salt as a source or means of life, and that a gift
of salt from the sovereign lays a new obligation on
the recipient, as illustrated in the days of Cyrus and
Darius,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> shows itself down to our own day. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
days of Arabi Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt desired to
raise a sum of money, at a time when the people were
exceptionally poor in consequence of excessive taxation
and the rigors of a recent famine. Instead of
relying on the ordinary and obnoxious tax collectors,
the Khedive resorted to the pressure of the "fidelity
to salt idea."</p>

<p>Salt, as a gift, or as an appeal, from the government
supply, was sent to every native house. Four
pecks of salt to every two males in the house was the
average amount. The salt was laid, by a government
official, upon the threshold of the house, early in the
morning, before the inmates arose. Of course, any
person stepping over that salted threshold was brought
anew into a covenant with the giver.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Later in the
day Egyptian soldiers called at every house to receive
what the inmates would give in return. The appeal
was irresistible. It was not like an ordinary tax, to
be evaded or resisted if possible. All would do what
they could. The least that any could think of returning
was the usual price of the salt. Those who could
afford more were glad to show their fidelity and loyalty
in a corresponding liberality.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<h2>XIV<br />
A SAVOR OF LIFE OR OF DEATH</h2>


<p>That which is a means of life in one instance may
be a means of death in another. A breath that might
kindle a tiny spark into a living blaze might also extinguish
a quivering flame. The breeze that gives life
to fire in one case gives death to fire in the other.
And fire itself proves death to that which is perishable,
while it gives added value to that which is purified
in the furnace flames. Salt, like fire, is a symbol
both of life and of death. In different connections it
is a preserver and a destroyer. "To the one a savor
from death unto death; to the other a savor from life
unto life."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Salt is spoken of in the Bible as destructive of
vegetable life, and a barrier against new animal life.
A piece of ground sown or strewed with salt is
deemed dead land: "It is not sown, nor beareth,
nor any grass groweth therein."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> When Abimelech
captured Shechem, "he beat down the city and sowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
it with salt."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The Psalmist, speaking of the power
and ways of God, declares:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He turneth rivers into a wilderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watersprings into a thirsty ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fruitful land into a salt desert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the wickedness of them that dwell therein."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The prophet Jeremiah says of one who departs from
God's service that he "shall inhabit the parched
places in the wilderness, a salt land and not inhabited."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Ezekiel, foretelling a curse on the land of
the Jews, says: "The marshes thereof shall not be
healed; they shall be given up to salt."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> And Zephaniah
declares that Moab shall become "a possession
of nettles, and salt-pits, and a perpetual desolation."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
Because there can be no fertility for new vegetable
life, there is no room or hope for new animal life for
land thus sown with salt and thus permanently sterile.</p>

<p>The one great body of water that is called the Dead
Sea is the saltest sea in the world. Five times the
proportion of salt in the ocean is found in this inland
sea of salt. "No fish can exist in the waters, nor is
it proved that any low forms of life have been discovered
there."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> An ancient legend declared that
birds could not even fly over its waters, because of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the curse from heaven on its briny depths.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Yet this
doomed and dead sea of salt is a source of life to man
in its exhaustless supply of salt for his use. Preeminently
is this salt of the Dead Sea a savor of life
and of death.</p>

<p>The salt of the ocean is the world's treasure. Without
it the greater portion of the earth's inhabitants
would perish for lack of what vivifies and preserves
animal life. Yet because of the salt in the ocean the
very water, which man and beast must have or perish
of thirst, is useless to both man and beast. The cry
in the "Ancient Mariner" is the cry of the human,
always, on the ocean's surface:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Water, water, everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all the boards did shrink:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Water, water, everywhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor any drop to drink."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Water, which is the gift of God to the thirsty soul,
mocks the thirsty soul when it brings with it salt,
which is the representative of life. Salt in water is a
savor of death unto death, while salt and water are
also a savor of life unto life.</p>

<p>While salt as the equivalent of life is a symbol of
permanency, it becomes, as the equivalent of death, a
symbol of doom and destruction. Thus the prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Isaiah, speaking of his salvation as sure and permanent,
says: "Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look
upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish
away [literally, shall be salted] like smoke, and the
earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that
dwell therein shall die in like manner [or, like gnats]:
but my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness
shall not be abolished."<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>Life is in itself the destroyer of death, as light is the
destroyer of darkness. Hence that which makes anew
does away with that which was of old. When, therefore,
salt or fire is spoken of as the destroyer of that
which is not worthy of preservation, it is not to be
wondered at that this power is possessed by an element
that purifies and revivifies through the process
of destruction. The ground of a destroyed and condemned
city is guarded against a continuance of its
old life of evil by being sown with salt, which is a
savor from life unto life and from death unto death.
The old heavens and the old earth which vanish away
as by fire and salt,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> are replaced by a new heaven and
a new earth<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> which shall be enduring as gold tried in
the fire, and as a covenant of salt forever.</p>

<p>There is a sense in which that which is devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
God is thereby forbidden to the use of man. Thus
land sown with salt may be counted as devoted and
as destroyed, <i>devoted</i> to God and <i>destroyed</i> for man.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
The Hebrew word <i>korban</i> was applied to what had
thus been dedicated and doomed.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>Blood also is used in the twofold sense of life and
of death, in different connections. Men say, "We
are bound together by blood," and "We are of one
blood," and "Blood is thicker than water." They
say, also, "There is blood between us," and "Spilled
blood cannot be gathered up," and "Blood is a barrier."
Salt, that stands for blood, may similarly stand
for life or for death, for peace or for discord. It is an
old superstition that to put salt on another's plate is
an evil omen. Hence the couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Help me to salt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help me to sorrow!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet even this portent of ill luck may be canceled by
a repetition of the act, helping to a second portion of
salt.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The taking of blood that becomes a barrier
may be followed by the taking of blood as a bond of
union. Shedding of blood is atoned for by sharing
of blood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>Even the spilling of salt, which is so dreaded in
primitive thought, may, it is said, be rendered harmless
if the person who was guilty of the mishap will
carefully gather up the spilled salt with the blade of
a knife, and throw it over his left shoulder, with an
appropriate invocation.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>It is deemed dangerous to give away salt to a
stranger; for because salt is as blood and as life, one
must be careful lest he put his blood and his life in
the power of an enemy.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Salt is essential to the
preservation of human life; at the same time, salt is
the destruction of human life if it be in too great
quantity or proportion. Thus the seeming contradiction
is only in seeming.</p>

<h2>XV<br />
MEANS OF A MERGED LIFE</h2>


<p>All life is from the Author and Source of life. Only
as two persons become partakers of a common life by
each and both sharing in that which is in itself life,
can they become one in the all-inclusive Life. Having
life from the Source of life, they can merge their
common possession in each other, and in that common
Source. Such merging in a common life, with
an appeal to and by the approval of God, or the gods,
has been the root-idea of covenanting, in one way or
another, from time immemorial, among all peoples,
the world over.</p>

<p>In primitive thought, and in a sense in scientific
fact, the blood is the life and the life is in the blood;
hence they who share in each other's blood are sharers
in a merged and common life. Covenanting in this
way with a solemn appeal to God, or to the gods, has
been a mode of sacred union from the earliest dawn
of human history. Two thus covenanting are supposed
to become of one being; the one is the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and the two are one. Every form of sacrifice, Jewish,
Egyptian, Assyrian, or ethnic, is in its primal thought
either an evidence and a reminder of an existing covenant
between the offerer and the Deity approached,
or an appeal and an outreaching for a covenant to be
consummated.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Salt is counted as the equivalent of blood and of
life, both in primitive thought and, in a sense, in scientific
fact; therefore salt, like blood, has been deemed
a nexus of a lasting covenant, as nothing can be
which is not life or its equivalent. Only as two persons
are sharers of a common life can they be supposed
to have merged their separate identity in that
dual union.</p>

<p>And so we find that, in the primitive world's thought,
shared salt has preciousness and power because of
what it represents and of what it symbolizes, as well as
of what it is. Salt stands for and corresponds with,
and it symbolizes, blood and life. As such it represents
the supreme gift from the Supreme Giver.
Because of this significance of salt, when made use
of as the means of a lasting union, the Covenant of
Salt, as a form or phase of the Blood Covenant, is a
covenant fixed, permanent, and unchangeable, enduring
forever.</p>

<h2>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AS A<br />
COVENANT OF LOVE</h2>


<p>All of us are familiar with the Ten Commandments,
given from God on two tables, or tablets, of stone, to
the people of Israel at Mount Sinai.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> But not all of
us are accustomed to think of these Ten Commandments
as ten separate clauses of a loving covenant
between God and his chosen people, recorded on
stone tablets for their permanent preservation. Yet
these witnessing tablets are repeatedly called in the
Bible "the tables of the covenant,"<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> and "tables of
testimony,"<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> not the tables of the commandments;
while the chest or casket which contained them is
called "the ark of the covenant,"<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and "the ark of
the testimony,"<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> not the ark of the commandments.</p>

<p>There is obviously a world-wide difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
a loving covenant that binds two parties to each other
in mutual affection and fidelity, and a series of
arbitrary commandments enjoined by a sovereign
upon his subjects; between a compact of union, having
its statement of promises on the one hand and of
responsibilities on the other, and an instrument that
asserts the rights of the ruler and defines the duties of
the ruled. In our estimate of the Decalogue we have
made too much of the <i>law</i> element, and too little of
the element of <i>love</i>. As a consequence it has not
been easy for us to see how it is that God's law is
love, and that love is the fulfilling of God's law. But
the Ten Commandments <i>are</i> a simple record of God's
loving covenant with his people, and they are <i>not</i> the
arbitrary commandings of God to his subjects. They
indicate the inevitable limits within which God and
his people can be in loving union, rather than declare
the limits of dutiful obedience on the part of those
who would be God's faithful subjects. A close
examination of the Decalogue will show that this is
its nature and scope.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, in our Bible reading, that
the Bible was originally written by Orientals for
Orientals, and that it is to be looked at in the light of
Oriental manners and customs, and Oriental modes of
speech, in order to its fullest understanding. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
when we find the term "covenant," or the term
"commandment," in the Bible, we are to inquire into
the Oriental meaning of that term, so that we may
know the sense in which it was employed by the
Bible writers.</p>

<p>Now a "covenant" among Orientals is, and always
has been, a sacred compact binding two parties in
loving agreement. Oriental covenants are made in
various forms and by various ceremonies. The most
sacred of all forms of covenanting in the East is by
two persons commingling their own blood, by its
drinking or by its inter-transfusing, in order that they
may come into a communion of very life.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Two persons
who wish to become as one in a loving blood-friendship
will open each a vein in his own arm, and
allow the blood to flow into a common vessel, from
which both parties will drink of the commingled
blood. Or, again, each person will open a vein in
one of his hands, and the bleeding hands will be
clasped together so that the blood from the one shall
find its way into the veins of the other. Or, yet
again, the two will share together the substitute blood
of a sacred animal. Usually, in such a case, a written
compact is signed by each party and given to the
other, with the stamp of the writer's blood upon it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
a part of the ceremony of covenanting; and this writing
is carefully encased in a small packet or casket,
and guarded by its holder as his very life. It is in the
light of such customs as this that we are to read of
the sacred covenant entered into between God and
his Oriental people.</p>

<p>It was at the foot of Mount Sinai that Moses came
before the people of Israel with God's proffer to them
of a covenant, whereby they should bear his name
and be known as his people. "And he took the
book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the
people: and they said, All that the Lord hath spoken
will we do, and be obedient."<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Then it was that
Moses took of substitute blood and divided it into two
portions, one half to be sprinkled on the altar God-ward,
and the other half to be sprinkled on the
people; and Moses said: "Behold the blood of the
covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning
all these words"&mdash;or, as the margin of the
Revised Version has it, "upon all these conditions."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, we are told, in the Epistle to the Hebrews,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
that Moses sprinkled the blood upon the
record, or book, of the covenant, as well as upon the
people. It was after this&mdash;after the breach and
the renewal of the covenant between Israel and God&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the stone tablets on which the covenant itself had
a permanent record were encased in a casket, or an
"ark,"<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> which was thenceforward guarded sacredly as
containing the charter of Israel's nationality, the witness,
the evidence, the testimony, of the loving covenant
between God and his people.</p>

<p>But you may ask, Did not the tables of stone bear
a record of specific commandments, rather than of
articles of a covenant? And are not the words there
recorded specifically called in the Bible the "Ten
Commandments"? Look for yourselves, and see.
It is true that our English Bible speaks of the Ten
Commandments recorded on these tables of stone;
but the word here translated "commandments" is
more literally to be rendered "words,"<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> as indeed it
is given in the margin of the Revised Version; and it
is applicable to any declaration, injunction, or charge,
made by one to another. It is by no means to be
understood as simply an arbitrary mandate from an
absolute sovereign to his subjects. Looking at the
Ten Commandments as a set of moral laws covering
man's duties to God and to his fellows, they seem
strangely defective, when we find among them no
command to pray to or to praise God, nor any command
to give sympathy or assistance to man. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
when we look at them as clauses of a loving covenant,
indicating the scope and limits of relations within
which a child of God's duties God-ward and man-ward
are to be exercised, we find that they are far-reaching
and all-inclusive. Looking at them as the
tables of the covenant between God and his people in
the light of Oriental views of covenanting, we can see
a great deal more in the words on those tables than
when we look at them as the tables of the commandments,&mdash;in
the light of our Western ideas of commandings.</p>

<p>A covenant involves the idea of a twofold agreement
between the parties making it. Even though
God himself be one of the parties, he will not refuse
to be explicit in his words of covenanting. And so
we find it to be in the record on the tables of the
covenant which were given to Moses at Mount Sinai.
We call the opening words of that record the "Preface
to the Ten Commandments;" but they are more
properly God's covenanting words with his people.
"I am Jehovah thy God, which brought thee out of
the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
The very name "Jehovah" includes the idea of a
covenant-making and a covenant-keeping God. The
declaration of Jehovah's eternally existing personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
as Jehovah is in itself a covenant promise, for all time
to come, to those who are his covenant people. It is
as though he were to say: "I, who was and am, and
am to be, the same yesterday and to-day, yea and
forever, will be your God unfailingly. As I have
given you a loving deliverance out of Egyptian
bondage, so I am ever ready to deliver you from
every evil that enthralls you."</p>

<p>Man, when he promises for the future, needs to
say, "I will do;" but God can say nothing stronger
than "I do," or than "I am." Thus the promise of
promises of Jesus to his disciples as their ever-present,
all-sustaining Lord, is, "Lo, I am with you alway;"<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
not "Lo, I <i>will be</i>," but "Lo, I <i>am</i>." And so it is
that God's covenant promise to Israel, to be their
loving, guarding, and guiding God for all time to
come, is in the words: "I am Jehovah thy God,
which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of
the house of bondage."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> And this is the promise of
"the party of the first part," as we would say in
modern legal parlance, in this covenant between God
and his people Israel.</p>

<p>Then there follow the covenant agreements of
God's people, as "the party of the second part" in
this loving compact. As it is God who prescribes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
defines the terms on which this covenant is to be
made, the indication of those terms is mainly in the
form of such prohibitions as will distinguish the people
of God from other peoples about them, in the bearing
of that people toward God's personality, toward God's
institutions, and toward God's representatives. This
is all that is needed in the fundamental articles of
covenanting. The details of specific duties may be
defined in special enactments under the terms of this
covenant, or they may be inferred from its spirit.</p>

<p>The first requirement is, that this covenanting God
shall be recognized as the only God; that no other
god shall be conceded a place in God's universe.
And this requirement is vital to any such covenant.
A divided heart is no heart at all. He who can see
any other object of love and devotion comparable
with the one to whom he gives himself in covenant-union,
is thereby incapacitated from a covenant-union.
Therefore it is that this first word of the Ten Words
of the covenant of God's people with their God is not
an arbitrary mandate, but is the simple expression of
a truth which is essential to the very existence of the
covenant as a covenant of union.</p>

<p>And this principle is as vitally important now as it
was in the days of Moses. The human heart is
always inclined to divide itself when it ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
undivided. It is reluctant to be wholly and always
true to God alone. But, now as hitherto, without
wholeness of heart a covenant of union with God is
an impossibility. And, indeed, the very idea of other
gods is an outgrowth of man's sense of an unfitness to
be in oneness of life with the One God,&mdash;in consequence
of which man seeks a lower divinity than
the supreme God as the immediate object of his
worship.</p>

<p>The second requirement in this covenant of union
is, that no material image or representation of this
covenanting God shall be made use of as a help to his
worship by his covenanting people; that, as a Spirit,
God shall be worshiped in spirit by his people. Here,
again, is no arbitrary mandate, but only the recognition
of a vital truth. Because God is Creator of all,
no creation of God can be like God. Because God is
a Spirit, the human mind can best commune with
him spiritually, without having its conceptions of him
degraded by any image or representation&mdash;which at
the best must be wholly unworthy of him.</p>

<p>In this second requirement, as in the first, a danger
is indicated to which the Israelites were peculiarly
exposed in their day, and to which all the people of
God are exposed in any day. In the Assyrian, or
Chaldean, home of Abraham, there was practically no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
image worship, but there was a belief in a plurality of
gods. In the Egyptian home, from which the Israelites
had just come out, images in great variety were
the objects of worship. As the covenant people of
God, the Israelites were to refrain from the polytheism
of their ancestral home in the far East, and from the
grosser idolatry of their more recent home in the
West. And so it must be with the people of God at
all times; they must worship only God, and they
must worship God without any help from a material
representation of the object of their worship.</p>

<p>As there is still a temptation to give a divided
heart to God, so there is still a temptation to seek the
help of some visible representation or symbol of
God's presence in his worship. The Christian believer
does not bow down to an idol, but many a
Christian believer thinks that his mind can be helped
upward in worship by looking at some representation
of his Saviour's face, or at some symbol of his
Saviour's passion. But just because God is infinitely
above all material representations and symbols, so
God can best be apprehended and discerned spiritually.
Anything coming between man's spirit and
God the Spirit is a hindrance to worship, and not a
help to it. Suppose a young man were watching
from a window for his absent mother's return, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
wish to catch the first glimpse of her approaching
face. Would he be wise, or foolish, in putting up a
photograph of his mother on the window-pane before
him, as a help to bearing her in mind as he looks for
her coming? As there can be no doubt about the
answer to that question, so there can be no doubt that
we can best come into spiritual communion with God
by closing our eyes to everything that can be seen
with the natural eye, and opening the eyes of our
spirit to the sight of God the Spirit. This, again, is
no arbitrary requirement of God; it is in the very
nature of his being and of our own.</p>

<p>The third requirement of this compact is, that there
shall be no insincerity on the part of God's covenant
people in their claiming and bearing his name, as the
name of their covenanting God. This requirement is
not generally understood in this light; but all the
facts in the case go to show that this is its true light.
In the Oriental world, and in the primitive world
everywhere, one's name stands for one's personality;
and the right to bear one's name or even to call on
one by his personal name, is a proof of intimate relation,
if not of actual union, with him. God was now
covenanting with this people to be his people, thereby
authorizing them to bear his name, and to be known
as his representatives. In the very nature of things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
this laid upon them a peculiar obligation to bear his
name reverently and in all sincerity.</p>

<p>It is not that God arbitrarily commanded his people
to have a care in the <i>speaking</i> of his name, as if he
were jealous of its irreverent mention; but it is that
he reminded them that the coming into the privileges
of his name was the coming into the responsibilities
of that name. It was as though Mr. Moody were
taking a little street waif into his home to train the
boy as his own son, and were formally giving to that
boy the right to take and bear his name. Naturally
he might say: "Understand, now, my boy, that,
wherever you go, they'll say, 'There goes a young
Moody.' Now, I value my name, and I don't want it
disgraced. See to it that you take care of that name
wherever you are." So God said to his people:
"Thou shalt not take"&mdash;shalt not assume, bear,
carry&mdash;"the name of the Lord thy God in vain"&mdash;insincerely,
vainly; "for the Lord will not"&mdash;cannot&mdash;"hold
him guiltless that taketh"&mdash;claimeth the privileges
of&mdash;"his name in vain"&mdash;vainly, insincerely.</p>

<p>This covenant obligation also is on us as it was on
God's people of old. As Christians we are baptized
into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Wherever we go, we are counted as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
members of God's family. His name is on us, and his
honor is in our keeping. Wherefore, "let every one
that nameth the name of the Lord"&mdash;claimeth it as
his own name&mdash;"depart from unrighteousness;"<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
and let him never feel that it is a light or a vain thing
to bear that name before the world.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the first three of the ten requirements
of the loving covenant of God's people with
their God are simply the requirements to worship
God as the only God, to worship him in unhindered
spirituality, and to worship him in all sincerity. These
three fundamental requirements seem to have been in
the mind of our Lord Jesus when he said to the
woman of Samaria at the well of Jacob: "God"&mdash;the
One God&mdash;"is a Spirit: and they that worship him
must worship in spirit and truth."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Coming to the fourth requirement of the loving
covenant of God and his people, we find it differing in
form from the preceding three requirements; differing
also from the form of all but one of those which
follow it. The preceding three are in the negative
form; this is in the affirmative form, beginning with
the injunction, "Remember" (Keep in mind). Of
course, there is a reason for this. The first three requirements
are in the line of obvious, if not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
self-evident, truths; the requirement of one day in seven
for rest and worship is not, however, of obvious importance.
Hence this requirement is specifically
affirmed as an article of the covenant, while the
others guard against departures from primal principles
of vital moment.</p>

<p>The "Sabbath" was a recognized institution long
before the days of Moses. Traces of its strict and
sacred observance in the ancestral home of Abraham
are disclosed in the Assyrian records unearthed in
these later days. And now that the Lord, at Sinai, is
drawing away his covenant people from the sins and
errors of their fathers and neighbors, he reminds them
that there is good in some of the observances of the
past, which they are not to forsake or forget. "Remember,"
therefore he says, "the sabbath day to
keep it holy"&mdash;as your fathers in all their polytheism
had a care to observe it of old. Bear <i>that</i> institution
in mind, as worth your remembering.</p>

<p>And here again there is affirmed a principle which
is for all time and for all people. Although the
reason for setting apart one day above another for
rest and worship is not on the surface of things, the
experiences of mankind, as well as the teachings of
God's Word, go to show that there is such a reason
below the surface. In the long run, man can do more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
work, and do it better, in six days of a week, than he
can in seven; and unless a man worships God at
stated times, he is not likely to worship him at all.
So it is that God makes it a part of his loving covenant
between himself and his people, that ever and
always they shall worship him statedly, as well as
worship him sincerely, spiritually, and solely; because
without this stated recognition of the covenant, the
covenant itself would be forgotten.</p>

<p>And now we come to the fifth of the ten covenant
requirements: "Honor thy father and thy mother."
This also is in the affirmative form, and for a very
good reason. God is here declaring, as it were, that
those who are in legitimate authority are so far his
representatives. He wants it understood that while
no other gods are in existence, even in a subordinate
place in the universe, he has his representatives in
various spheres of human government and rule, and
they are to be honored accordingly by his covenant
people.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to speak of the division of the
Ten Commandments into two tables, the first comprising
four requirements, and the second six; but it
will be seen that this fifth requirement belongs with
the preceding four in the group of those which look
God-ward. It is as though the one table pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
upward from ourselves, while the other pointed outward.
We are to honor those who are over us in the Lord,
not as our fellows, but as our superiors; not because
of what they are as men, but because they are, within
the scope of their rule, the representatives of our God.</p>

<p>By Oriental custom the terms "father" and
"mother" are by no means limited to one's natural
parents, but are applicable to superiors in years, or in
wisdom, or in civil or religious station. This truth
was impressed on my mind by an incident in my
journey across the desert of Sinai. My companions
in travel were two young men, neither of them a relative
of mine,&mdash;as my dragoman very well knew.
When, however, in mid-desert, we met an old Arab
shaykh, through whose territory we were to pass, my
dragoman introduced me as the father of these young
men. "No, they are not my <i>sons</i>," I said to the
dragoman; but his answer was: "That's all right.
Somebody must be father here." And when I found
that, according to the Arab idea, every party of travelers
must have a leader, and that the leader of a
party was called its "father," I saw that it would look
better for me to be called the father of the young
men, than for one of them to be called my father.</p>

<p>Traces of this idea are found in the Bible use of the
term "father." In Genesis, Jabal is said to be "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
father of such as dwell in tents, and have cattle;"<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
the man who started the long line of nomad shepherds.
Jubal is called "the father of all such as
handle the harp and pipe;"<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> the pioneer instrumental
musician of our race. Joseph in Egypt speaks of
himself as "a father to Pharaoh,"<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> in view of the confidence
reposed in him by the ruler of the empire.
"Be unto me a father and a priest,"<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> says Micah to
the young Levite, in the days of the Judges; because
a religious guide is, in the East, counted as in a
peculiar sense a representative of God.</p>

<p>It is not merely that the terms "father" and
"mother" <i>may</i> include others besides human parents,
but it is that no Oriental would think of limiting
those terms to that relationship. Hence this fifth requirement
of the covenant of God's people with their
God, just as it stands, is in substance: Honor those
who are over you in the Lord, as the representatives
of the Lord; for the powers that be are ordained of
God,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and he who fails to honor them lacks in due
honor to him who has deputed them to speak and to
act for himself. And herein is affirmed a principle
which is as important to us to-day as it was to the
Israelites in the days of Moses. Indeed, it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
questioned whether any precept of the ten covenant
requirements has a more specific bearing on the
peculiar needs of the American people, than this injunction
to reverence those who are in authority because
they are God's representatives in their sphere.
Anarchy can have no tolerance in the mind of a child
of God; but reverence for rightful authority has its
home there.</p>

<p>Turning from the first table of the covenant with its
upward look, to the second table with its outward
look, we find that each new requirement in its order
stands for a great principle which is applicable alike to
all peoples and to all times, and which has its basis in
man's loving union with God. The first of this series,
the sixth of the ten requirements, is: "Thou shalt not
kill;" or, "Thou shalt do no murder." Here is a
great deal more than an ordinance forbidding the
striking down to death of a fellow-man. Here is a
call of God to guard sacredly the life of every child
of God, as that which is dear to God. In the Oriental
world, as in the primitive world generally, blood
stands for life, and life is supposed to proceed from
God and to return to God. When, therefore, an
Oriental is told that he must not take it upon himself
to shed another's blood, he realizes that that prohibition
is equivalent to saying that it is not for him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
decide when a life that God has given shall be recalled
to God.</p>

<p>This idea it is that runs through the whole system
of what is popularly known as "blood revenge" in the
East. "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall
his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he
man,"<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> was the declaration of God as early as the
days of Noah; and it is in the line of that declaration
that any man in the East who sheds another's blood
must surrender his own blood to the other's family, at
the present day&mdash;as ever since the days of Noah.
Not personal revenge, but divine equity, is the real
basis of this system. Not because the life belongs to
the man, but because it belongs to God, must it be
guarded sacredly, and be accounted for&mdash;if taken
away.</p>

<p>It is on this principle that the civil magistrate, as
the messenger of God, takes the life of one who has
taken another's life, in these days of the Christian dispensation.
"He beareth not the sword in vain: for
he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him
that doeth evil."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> A child of God must count sacred
every life which God has given; and except while
acting as a specific messenger of God, he must never
send back a human life to God.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>The seventh covenanting requirement is a call to
regard the family institution as an institution of God's
appointing, and to refrain from aught that tends to its
injury. "Thou shalt not commit adultery" means a
great deal more than Refrain from unchastity because
of its harm to yourself or to your neighbor. It
means, Guard God's primal institution for man, as an
institution which God holds dear. At the very beginning
of the race, it was ordained of God that one man
and one woman&mdash;the twain, not the three, or the four,
but the twain&mdash;should be one flesh in loving union.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
This institution of God's ordaining is dear to God, and
it ought to be dear to every child of his; therefore
God says to those who would be in loving compact
with him, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." Because
your and my interests are made one, you must
not, you cannot, as my loving people, do aught that
shall prove injurious to the family&mdash;to the institution
which I have established, and which is dear to my
heart.</p>

<p>This, again, is not an arbitrary commandment; nor
is it one for a single period, or for a single people
only. It is the enunciation of a principle which is
vital to the well-being of all peoples at all times. It
was so from the beginning, and it must be so unto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
end. The family is the unit in the State and in the
Church. It must not be ignored in the realm of
society, of government, or of religion. He who would
be true to God must be true to the institution of the
family. And who shall say that we have no need of
remembering this truth in our land and day?</p>

<p>The eighth requirement of the covenant guards the
rights of property as within the plan and ordering of
God. "Thou shalt not steal" is announced as an
article of the loving compact of God's people with
their God. Not merely because your fellow-man
would object to your taking his property from him,
but because the rights of property are of divine appointment,
are you to refrain from claiming as your
own that which now belongs to another.</p>

<p>This idea of regarding property rights as of God's
appointment is peculiarly prevalent in the Oriental
mind. The lines of tribal division in the desert are
recognized as having divine sanction; and now, as in
the days of old, it is hardly less than sacrilege to remove
an ancient landmark in the East. Tribes which
are at enmity will make raids across these border lines
for purposes of plunder; but this is in the nature of
what "civilized" nations call a "military necessity."
Again, a stranger who enters a tribal domain without
obtaining consent is treated as a smuggler, and all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
property is confiscated accordingly. This, however,
merely shows the primitive origin of the "high tariff"
principle. Orientals who plunder from their enemies,
or who collect impost duties from immigrants, do so
in the belief that God sanctions these habits of the
ages.</p>

<p>When one of the Arabs of our party, in crossing the
desert of Sinai, found he had dropped a bag of meal,
he went back to look for it, in perfect confidence that
it would be left untouched by others. On my asking
him if he had no fear that another Arab had carried it
off, he replied that no Arab would steal from an Arab.
Dr. Edward Robinson<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> saw a black tent hanging on
a tree, where, as he was told, it had remained a full
year awaiting its owner's return; and he says that if
a loaded camel dies on the desert its owner draws a
circle in the sand about it, and leaves it without any
fear that it will be disturbed in his absence. Burckhardt<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
illustrates the estimate put by the Arabs on
stealing, by the story of an Arab father who bound
his own son hand and foot, and cast him headlong to
death from a precipice, because the son had stolen
from one of his tribal fellows. Life can only be
taken at the call of God; but, according to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Oriental view, he who violates the property rights of
one of God's children forfeits his very life to God.</p>

<p>The principle underlying this estimate of the sacredness
of property rights, like every other principle
enunciated in the Decalogue, is not an outgrowth of
an arbitrary commandment, but it inheres in the very
nature of God's dealings with the sons of men. What
hast thou that thou didst not receive by God's consent?<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
What has thy fellow that he did not receive
by the same permission? It is God who gives. It is
for God to take away.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> No loving child of God will
refuse to heed the limits which his Father has assigned
in the distribution of his possessions among the children
of his love. That was the way in which the
Orientals were taught to look at it. That is the way
in which we ought to view it. Anti-property communism
is rebellion against God.</p>

<p>Ninth in the list of the covenant requirements
comes the summons to hold in sacred regard the personal
reputation, or good name, of every child of
God. "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbor" is a prohibition of slander, or of careless
speech affecting the good name of one's fellow-man.
This is not, as many have supposed, a mere injunction
to truthful speech on all occasions. Lying needs no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
specific prohibition in a loving compact between God
and his people; although the duty of truthfulness is
inseparable from the thought of any compact with
God&mdash;who could not be God if he were to approve
untruthfulness.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> But a disregard by man of the reputation
of his fellow-man does need to be guarded
against in such a compact; therefore its mention has
a place here. A child's good name is always dear to
his father. He who loves and honors the father will
not be heedless of the reputation of the child. God
is the Father of all. The good name of every one of
his children is dear to him. He who loves and
honors God will not be careless of the reputation of
any one of God's dear children. Therefore it is that,
in the loving covenant of God with his people, it is
declared that love for God includes a truthful fidelity
to the good name of every child of God.</p>

<p>How the application of this principle comes home
to us in our social life as God's children! We are
jealous of the good name of the members of our own
families. We are tender of the reputation of those
whom we know to be very dear to our dearest friends.
But how careless we are of the good name of those in
whom we feel no special concern, or of the reputation
of those who happen to be personally disagreeable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
us! We hear and repeat the words spoken to their
discredit without knowing whether or not those words
are true. By our unguarded speech or looks we
help, perhaps, to give a false impression to others
concerning them. And all the while they are God's
dear children, and every spiteful or thoughtless blow
at them is a stroke at him. Is this consistent with
our claim of loving union with their God and ours?</p>

<p>It was in the line of this principle that our Lord
Jesus gave emphasis to his one new commandment,
that those who loved him should love one another, as
being dear to him;<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and, again, that he declared that
whoever ministered tenderly to one of his disciples
should be reckoned as ministering to himself.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> God
links himself in loving sympathy with all his children,
and he wants their welfare to be held dear by all who
hold him dear.</p>

<p>And now we come to the tenth and last of the requirements
of this covenant. Here we find an injunction
that goes deeper than those which precede it
on the second tablet of the written compact. "Thou
shalt not covet." Not only, Thou shalt not openly
disregard human life, or the family institution, or the
property or the reputation of any one of thy fellows;
but, Thou shalt not want to do any of these things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Thou shalt recognize thine own lot, and thy possessions,
and the lot and the possessions of others, as
God's assignment to thee and to them; and thou
shalt be contented within the sphere which he has
deemed best for thee.</p>

<p>This requirement in the second table of the compact
corresponds with the third requirement in the
first table. The one says that the child of God must
be sincere and unfeigned in his loving devotedness to
God as his Father; the other says that the child of
God must accept in all heartiness his Father's ordering
concerning himself, in his relations to all his
brothers and sisters in the great family of God.</p>

<p>Here it is that we find the more spiritual teachings
of the Decalogue concerning man's obligations to his
fellow-man in the loving service of God, as they are
pointed out, and emphasized in the words of Jesus, in
what we call the Sermon on the Mount.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Here it is
that the lesson comes home to us that it is not enough
for us to refrain from actual murder and adultery and
theft and false witnessing; but that it is inconsistent
with our devotedness to God as our loving Father for
us to have a hateful thought toward one of his dear
children; for us to look longingly in the direction of
another family assignment than that which is ours in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the way of God's appointment; for us to turn a wistful
or an envious thought toward any possession of
another which we have no right to seek after. And
all this is not of God's arbitrary commanding, but is
in the very essence of God's loving covenanting with
his chosen people. Therefore it is that the Apostle
urges Christians to keep themselves from "fornication,
uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness,
the which is <i>idolatry</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> the indulging in which
is being untrue to God as one's covenant God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now in the light of these disclosures of the
nature and meaning of the successive clauses of this
covenant of God with his Oriental people, let us look
back upon it as a whole in its spirit and teachings, in
order that we may see what is covered by it, and
wherein its applications are for us as well as for God's
people of old. God must be recognized as God alone.
No heart can love God as God, unless that heart
loves God wholly. God must be worshiped spiritually;
for spiritual things are spiritually discerned, and
only as a man is lifted above sight and sense can he
be in communion with the spiritual and the infinite.
Union with God must be sincere and unfeigned; for
only by a complete and willing surrender of one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
self can one's self be merged into a holy and infinite
Personality. The loving worship of God must have
its stated times, and hence, of course, its stated places,
in order to have its fitting hold on the worshiper;
and the recognition of this truth in the covenant is
the authorization of all legitimate seasons and methods
of worship. God's representatives in the family, in
the State, and in the Church, are to be honored as
God's representatives; and herein is the authorization
of all right forms of human rule. These are the
teachings of the first table of the covenant; and those
of the second table are like unto them.</p>

<p>He who loves God must love those who are God's.
As the Apostle expresses it: "If a man say, I love
God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that
loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot
love God whom he hath not seen. And [therefore]
this [second] commandment have we from him, that
he who loveth God love his brother also."<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Every
child of man is a child of God. Wayward and prodigal
son though he be, he still is one who was made in
the image of God; and his Father's heart goes out
toward him unfailingly in love. Hence he who loves
the Father must guard with sacredness the life of
every child of that Father. He must honor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
institution of the family, which is the human hope of the
children of that Father. He must hold dear the
property possessions and the good name of each and
every child of that Father. And in his heart there
must be such love for that Father's children as the
children of his Father, that he will have no wish to
do aught that shall harm any one of them in any
degree.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the spirit and substance of the entire
covenant compact stand out in those words of our
Lord which lose their meaning if we look at the Ten
Commandments as ten arbitrary commandings of
God. When a certain lawyer came to Jesus with the
knotty question, "Master, which is the great commandment
in the law?" Jesus said unto him: "Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the
great and first commandment. And a second like
unto it is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
On these two commandments hangeth the
whole law, and the prophets."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> And thus it is that
we are enabled to realize that "love ... is the fulfilment
of the law."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The "Ten Commandments" are the law, the law
of the covenant of love; but, be it remembered, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
are not the "Mosaic law." They were not originated
by Moses; nor were they done away with when the
Mosaic law was fulfilled and abrogated in Christ.
They are the law of the promptings of love; an
orderly statement of the principles which rule in a
heart which is devoted to God. Their origin is in the
nature of God; and their continuance must be coexistent
with the needs of the children of God. With
all our shortcomings in love, and with all our failures
in fidelity to our covenant-union with God in Christ
Jesus, just so far as we are in oneness with God by
faith shall we be true to the principles of this covenant-compact
of God with his people. "God is love; and
he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God
abideth in him."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> "And hereby know we that we
know him, if we keep his commandments."<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<span class="large">War Memories of an Army Chaplain</span><br />
<i>With 14 full-page Illustrations</i><br />
<i>Crown 8vo. $2.00</i>
</p>

<p>"This is incomparably the best chaplain's story which the great
war has produced."&mdash;<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Trumbull gives us no story, merely single incidents, and in
them we find the tenderness and reverence and bravery and indomitable
spirit of the American soldier. His book is throughout a eulogy
of the American private soldier; the man upon whose patience and
fidelity, obedience to superiors, and heroism the success of our arms
must eventually depend."&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>"Chaplain Trumbull has given us an interesting volume, which is
well worth reading, for its impressions have the stamp of truth, and
he tells his story well."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle.</i></p>

<p>"It is safe to say that no chaplain in the Civil War was more
widely known or did more effective service than the Rev. H. Clay
Trumbull.... Add to this qualification the fact that Mr. Trumbull
is a man of hearty sympathy, wide knowledge of human nature,
and genial humor, and it will be concluded that this volume, called
'War Memories of an Army Chaplain,' is well worth reading. Emphatically
it is so, and particularly at this time, when the subject of
soldier life and the treatment of soldiers is so near to us. The book
abounds in significant and entertaining incidents, and is thoroughly
enjoyable from cover to cover."&mdash;<i>The Outlook.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Trumbull has given us a book upon the Civil War which is
in some respects unique.... Mr. Trumbull's chapters on Religious
Services in the Field, on Chapels, on Sermons, on Pastoral
Work, are full of interesting matter."&mdash;New York <i>Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>"This is an interesting and valuable work, not primarily historical
in aim, yet casting upon the history of the Civil War a good deal of
important light.... This personal record is as entertaining as
it can be; parts of it are thrilling."&mdash;<i>The Historical Review.</i></p>

<p>"A volume packed full of interesting reminiscences, anecdotes,
and relations that bring back to us the war period from a fresh standpoint.
Perhaps nobody knows as much about real army life as the
regimental chaplain."&mdash;<i>Review of Reviews.</i></p>

<p>"The facts are indisputable, and they tell their own story. Nor
can we refrain from commending the volume as a most striking and
valuable contribution to the religious thought of the world. It is
emphatically one of the few books that no religious thinker can afford
to be without."&mdash;<i>President</i> <span class="smcap">W. R. Harper</span>, <i>in the Old Testament
Student.</i></p>

<p>"We thank the author for this fruit of vast labor and persevering
research. It is worthy of the study of all students of religion."&mdash;<i>Rev.</i>
<span class="smcap">Charles A. Briggs, D. D.</span></p>

<p>"It seems to us to throw a true and important light upon the sacrament
of the Holy Communion, and to rescue it alike from Roman
perversion and Zwinglian degradation. Throughout we have been
impressed by its reserve of power, its care not to press unduly any
analogy. It seems to us a model of what biblical study should be."&mdash;<i>The

<p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> Professor Collitz says, on this point: "The Early European word for
salt, <i>sal</i> (nominative <i>s&#275;-d</i>, genitive <i>sal-n-és</i> according to Joh. Schmidt)
which probably goes back to the Indo-European period, may be derived
from the same root to which the Sanskrit <i>ás-r-g</i> (genitive <i>as-n-ás</i>) 'blood,'
and Latin <i>s-an-gu-i-s</i> (genitive <i>s-an-gu-in-is</i>) belong. The latter, as F. de
Saussure (<i>Système primitif des voyelles Indo-Européennes</i>, Leipzig, 1897,
p. 225) has shown, comes from a root <i>es</i>, which lost its initial vowel if the
suffix was accented. If we connect the two groups of words, we should
say that <i>sal</i> is derived from this root <i>es</i> by a suffix <i>al</i>, similar to the
suffix <i>el</i> in the word for 'sun' (Indo-European <i>s&#275;'v-el</i>, from root <i>s&#275;v</i>),
or to the suffix <i>a-lo</i> in Greek <i>meg-a-lo-s</i> as compared with <i>meg-a-s</i>. The
root <i>es</i> is probably the same from which the word for 'to be' (Sanskrit
<i>as-mi</i>, Latin <i>sum</i>) is derived, and the meaning of which seems to have
been originally 'to live.'"</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_204_204" id="Footnote_204_204"></a><a href="#FNanchor_204_204"><span class="label">[204]</span></a> It has indeed been questioned whether the overturned salt-cellar in
Da Vinci's picture, as shown in many an engraving of it, was in the original
painting, as it is not to be seen there now. But it would seem clear that
the copy of this painting by Da Vinci's pupil, Marco d'Oggoni, in the
Brera, shows the overturned salt-cellar, while the original painting has
had several retouchings and renovations. (See <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 6th
Series, Vol. X., p. 92 f.)</p></div>
